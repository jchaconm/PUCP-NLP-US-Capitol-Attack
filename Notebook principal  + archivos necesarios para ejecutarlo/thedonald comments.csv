"two more weeks, amirite? boy it would be nice if something actually happened.",11RhKDWsS8,237
we'll know in 13 more days,11RhKDWsS8,176
"Seriously, if you can't hold out for 13 more fucking days before dooming I'm not sure you ever deserved a seat on the train to begin with. You made it this far, at least finish the fucking ride.",11RhKDWsS8,220
"I'm finishing the ride, but that video earlier took the wind out of my sails and gut punched the following breath right out.",11RhKDWsS8,112
"I've been thinking about this. The Founders were young, energetic, and in positions of respect, wealth, and sometimes power. They also were NUMEROUS. And despite their many differences, they shared the same goal and dedicated themselves to it. Trump is basically ONE MAN. And the borg monster of government aka deep state has grown ten million times in size since the Founding. It's just not realistic to think that one man - even the near perfect fighter that Trump is - can do it. The whole world was against him, and he still accomplished more in four years than any president in my lifetime (I'm 51). We're too stuck on superheroes in this culture. Trump is the closest human to a superhero we'll ever have. God bless him.",11RhKDWsS8,110
We were supposed to be the new founders. We failed him. We are the ones who have to fight now.,11RhKDWsS8,52
"Go read some history. Li Zicheng took down the entire Ming Dynasty, the largest empire in the world at the time with a crushing bureaucracy. He was a nobody. He worked as a farmhand, a shop clerk, a failed blacksmith apprentice, and a mail carrier. But he and three guys raided the local magistrate’s office, took their weapons, and 10 years later he walked into Beijing while the last emperor ran away to hang himself on a hill with his eunuch lover. When the people are desperate enough and have nothing to lose but their life, they will stand up and follow anyone willing to lead. I don’t think the populist movement is going anywhere. It just learned a lesson that our system is immune to being fixed from within. When the Bernie left and the Trump right realize this and negotiate an alliance, something will happen.",11RhKDWsS8,42
"Trump is basically ONE MAN. And the borg monster of government But he always had us. We would've supported any bold move he made. If he fired people the moment they went squirrely on him, we would've supported it. If would've fired Sessions the day he recused himself, we would've supported it. If he would've ordered federal marshals to voting centers the night of the election, we would've supported it. If he would've sent in NG to quell the BLM rioters, we would've supported it. If he would've ordered governors to not engage in any lockdowns or unconstitutional mandates, we would've been there. He was paralyzed by bad advisors, optics, poll numbers and media. But he always had us right there with him all the time but he never seemed to appreciate that power. He seemed too focused on the other side's views.",11RhKDWsS8,19
"He ain't done yet. He said it's only the beginning
Transition of power does not nesc mean from Trump to Biden
exhausted every legal option does not mean he exhausted every option.",11RhKDWsS8,19
We need many many Trumpian esque figures to win this war. Time to rise up pedes. Never give up.,11RhKDWsS8,2
"Yesterday was the death of the old, corrupt America. Today is the birth of a new America.",11RhKDWsS8,16
It's always darkest before the dawn.,11RhKDWsS8,16
just realize you are not alone. over 80 million americans feel EXACTLY like you do right now. we are in this together,11RhKDWsS8,13
"Hold on, brother. This is the time right now that tests our faith. Waiting. Not knowing what is happening. But hold fast. It IS happening. DC in lockdown. MILOPS live now. Final act coming.",11RhKDWsS8,7
You haven't seen any fight from Trump yet. All those chess pieces he has placed have not yet been used.,11RhKDWsS8,5
And it’s a YUGE chessboard,11RhKDWsS8,1
"Being real, we lost the presidency after yesterday. Not fairly, but it is what it is. Trump didn’t throw in the towel though. He’s moving onto the next battle field, which is starting our own media organization. The media are more powerful than the president, and one of the main sources of the problem. He’s going all in on that, and we’ll be there like we already are to support it. 2022 and 2024 are going to be giant pushbacks the likes of which the left has never seen.",11RhKDWsS8,23
"Not fairly, but it is what it is. Bullshit defeatist attitude. It is what it is? The election was 100% rigged and its unacceptable and will never be acceptable. Thats how it is and will be! 2022 and 2024 Are going to be pre-determined months/years ahead of time. Actual elections no longer exist in case you havent noticed.",11RhKDWsS8,70
"There's a difference between accepting something morally and accepting that something has happened. It is unacceptable that the election was stolen, but at this point it is clear that that is what has happened. If you're only interested in fighting for the next 13 days, the movement will not last long.",11RhKDWsS8,36
"true story. I'm not at all interested in any election that I'm not running in. Every one of us should be in one of those elections. if Trump calls in the next two weeks, I will answer and I will not go unarmed. But I don't vote or pay taxes until they count.",11RhKDWsS8,6
"My opinion of the matter is that we need to get organized and mobilized nationwide. Move off these sites, not that I dont appreciate them, and, we do something...different thats been done before. Perhaps in this very country. By people this movement might look up to.",11RhKDWsS8,2
"Trump has literally come out and said he is transitioning on the 20th.
This is just called reality and it's coming from him.
It's REGROUP time. I think it's time to hook up with militias etc.
Trump has to have time too.
Noone's saying ""give up"" - just wait and Regroup. We're all p***** off and raw right now.",11RhKDWsS8,2
"And it won't be long, Trump is going to be dead. They won't let him live to do anything.",11RhKDWsS8,0
So his big plan is to have a tv channel in a banana republic? That's lovely.,11RhKDWsS8,24
"That's what media have floated - not Trump. And he's going to need some sort of apparatus to make money from too.
Stop with the whining too - HE'S BEEN SLOGGING IT FOR 4 FRIGGIN YEARS in the swamp.",11RhKDWsS8,2
We do not need him,11RhKDWsS8,-3
"He’s moving onto the next battle field, which is starting our own media organization. He’s not doing anything. They will make an example out of him.",11RhKDWsS8,21
"Exactly. Which is why I hope this ""speech"" is a head fake because if he doesn't go Nuclear Lincoln, Biden's handlers will thrash him and his family viciously and manipulate the law to do real harm to them. If Trump thinks he's safe just conceding, he's terribly wrong.",11RhKDWsS8,4
We lost jack shit yesterday. That was pure optics. The results were paid for months to years in advance.,11RhKDWsS8,18
"Could not agree more. Trump being out of the spotlight allows him a wide path toward retribution, and we have all seen what happens when you try to get the best of him. Trump knew where bodies were buried by the elites before he was ever President . Imagine what he knows now after 4+ years of that and having intelligence and people like General Flynn at his side. As disheartening as it is right now, I know that he said, what he said, to ultimately be able to further his cause in the near future. I hope to see Trump on some show in February where he is pitching his upcoming book that will tell the truth of our Government corruption. They at least controlled him a bit when he was President, I wanna see “Unchained Trump” in action.",11RhKDWsS8,8
I agree with a lot of this. The media should not be setting our priorities every day or deciding what can or can’t be discussed. They need to be reined in. However 2022 and 2024 look bleak. Who will be worthy of our votes? Seems like things are going to have to get physical before these representatives get in line. Yesterday only emboldened them to condemn us even harder than they already have. I’ve never seen Congress so unified as they were yesterday rebuking the protesters. They despise us.,11RhKDWsS8,12
Are we back to believing our votes are worthy? Did we all forget why we’re in this predicament? Our votes mean nothing.,11RhKDWsS8,22
Was ted cruz a may on the final complaint ? i'd vote for Ted Cruz. Not that voted will likely be counted.,11RhKDWsS8,3
"Do you really think POTUS would abandon us? Give up after all we've been though? Do you really think he didn't know ALL OF THIS WAS LIKELY TO GO DOWN THAT WAY IT JUST DID? Military was ALWAYS the final solution. Just had to let it all play out. NOW WE KNOW WHO ALL THE TRAITORS ARE. Trump did not concede. Yes, he said there would be a peaceful transition to a new administration. MAYBE A TRUMP/FLYNN ADMIN?? I'm guessing his ""proclamation"" sending everyone home peacefully just activated the Insurrection Act. DC is reportedly on total lockdown. He wanted his supporters out of harm's way. To me, that means MILOPS are active NOW. If so, they will be as quiet, quick and surgical as possible. Now we wait. And pray. It ain't over.",11RhKDWsS8,6
"Dude, just chill right now. You think picking up some Flags and protesting right now is gonna do anything? Isolated acts of Patriot violence??? This is a freakn Govt. apparatus - with Police forces, Nat Guard & military. Being pissed off isn't enough like it was 100 years ago.
Just wait to regroup. In the meantime, prepare locally to build yourself up.. stock your shelves, & all that survival stuff we all know about.
Prepare and wait.",11RhKDWsS8,3

"This!!! He’s kept every promise but one....draining the swamp. Did everyone forget that there are no brakes on this train? I’m riding this train to wherever it takes us. He said a new admin. Meaning without Pence, it’s not over till it’s over. I’ll concede when Trump does.",11RhKDWsS8,22
"Thank you.
It's been a very difficult day for me. I'm not sure I will financially make it thru the 1st yr of Bidet. I'm truly afraid for my country and myself. I never thought I'd be homeless again.
I've been looking everywhere for some words of hope today. For someone who still has fight in them.",11RhKDWsS8,9
"Here's some hope for you: He never conceded. He said ""THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING."" Do you really think POTUS would give up or abandon us now, after everything we have gone through? Do you think he would make a deal with the DS? No way. They want him DEAD. This was a plan long in the making. Long in the unfolding. Setting everything up and then watching the dominos fall. Learning who ALL the traitors are, including Pence, Loeffler, and the other cowards who promised to object to the votes and then cucked out. Now we KNOW. This is the toughest part. The waiting. The lack of contact. This is the time that tests our faith. Hold fast. Trump's ""proclamation"" to go home peacefully activated the Insurrection Act. The plan was never for us to see tanks in the street and martial law across the nation. Reports are coming in now that DC is in total lockdown with guns in the street. Monkeywerx and others are reporting crazy heavy mil air traffic over DC and elsewhere. If MILOPS are happening now, they will be as swift, surgical and quiet as possible, until they are ready to announce that the swamp has been drained. Until I know different, I am keeping the faith. And praying. It ain't over!",11RhKDWsS8,2

"If you go to socialist places without a lot of immigration, like Vermont where working men are going extinct, you can make a decent living with a blue collar job.

"American’s everywhere are hurting, we are in this together and Trump is not going to let us down. Q isn’t a larp, it is either real or Trump was always gonna screw us and I don’t believe this is the case. We have lasted this long we owe him 12 more days. Our founding fathers walked barefoot through snow to kill enemies and it’s always darkest before dawn. The world will be shocked at what’s coming in the next two weeks. Hang in there fren, it’s gonna be a bumpy ride but if we can pull this off it will be legendary. To all those who say fucking Qtard just remember Flynn tweeted out WWG1WGA, also mentioned digital soldiers over and over and over. Here’s more proof, please watch, you’ll feel better. We are about to find out how deep the rabbit hole goes. https://conspiracynomore.com/ultimate-qproofs-video/",11RhKDWsS8,1
"I’m no Biden fan but he did say he wants to send $2,000 checks as soon as he’s inaugurated, and Harris backed a bill that would send $2k checks monthly for an indefinite period of time. It’s the Republicans that have been holding up direct cash transfers, but now the Dems will control the legislature and the executive, so they’ll be able to pass stimulus measures.",11RhKDWsS8,-9
UBI is the left's wet dream...,11RhKDWsS8,6
This is one of the worst comments I've seen here,11RhKDWsS8,5
Lol what stupid bullshit.,11RhKDWsS8,2
"That my hope, it’s either happening or they are about to unleash the left and declare all of us insurrectionist. GEOTUS said yesterday he will never concede and then this today? This was NOT a concession speech. We’ll soon see I guess.",11RhKDWsS8,4
I'm with you there! Exhausted every legal option is not exhausting every option. Flynn's been itching to use the military option for a while now but Trump wanted to give them all a fair chance. He's a gentleman that way,11RhKDWsS8,5
"I love him but… There’s more than one promise he didn’t fulfill. The dishonesty around here has always turned me off. We’re supposed to be Trump supporters, not Fanboys worshiping the golden calf. That’s always bothered me.",11RhKDWsS8,5
"Some have set him up to be a God - I'm all in on whatever /whichever way Trump goes. I'm always* praying he has the plan and ends up on top but I'm a realist too.
And as far as ""he hasn't kept every promise""... how could he?? The govt isn't set up to be a monarchy of full Presidential power. Not only did he have legal checks & balances, he had a 3 tiered COUP of Dems, Repubs & Justice system knocking out every LEGAL move he had.
They're pure evil. But let's not forget, the vital positions in Govt that he chose were all our enemies. CIA, DOJ, FBI, SCOTUS. He couldn't have known but that's exactly what happened.",11RhKDWsS8,3
"I am worried that the only reason he didn't use the word ""concede"" is because he had not long before swore that he would never concede ever.",11RhKDWsS8,1
"We're all ""battle fatigued"".
I understand that morale and emotions are at an all time low. Esp after seeing the #2 guy f*ck us all.
But we must think of Trump. How hard he's fought and is still fighting.
He needs us to be strong & hold the line for a couple more weeks. It's not over until he actually leaves.
He fights we fight.
We have to keep the momentum he started no matter who's in our Government.",11RhKDWsS8,7
"Fear is confining and low-energy. So is depression. So is self-pity. If you can convert these emotions into anger, well now you’ve got something to keep you warm and energized and maybe even safer. We have a lot to be angry about, it’s a target rich environment. Today I put Traitor Pence’s pic on my dartboard and gave it the voodoo treatment, it did actually cheer me up a bit seeing his face completely covered with sharp spikes. Go out to the country and practice your shooting skills, imagine your target as a scumbag of your choice and your aim will improve, I promise.",11RhKDWsS8,1
"Dude, be angry! But don't be stupid. We're ALL angry - in fact, I'm in full hostile HATE mode and have been for a long time. But tell me what that does in stopping what's happening. Nothing. Frankly we're emotionally exhausted too.
Jan 6th was essentially the death of his 2nd term becuz of Media narrative. I'll never forget Trump at the beginning of Covid when he started the briefings - he had a dejected look on his face and said ""they set the narratives"" - that's when it was starting to get away from him. His control on it. they were running w/ lockdowns, draconian crap... fearmongering.
The same is true in this - OPTICS matter - they use anything they can.
Anyways, anger isn't enough for this huge beast of a system. Just wait and see.
We'll adapt to info we get. No it's not over, but the way forward will probly shift.",11RhKDWsS8,1

"Thank you for telling the truth. We are deeper now than we've ever been, and we're not allowed to even talk about it.",11RhKDWsS8,45
"We need to be honest with each other here because we are not here for one man. We are here for our republic. If we can’t be honest about a man who we all love but deeply deeply let us down, then we have no chance. None. We can’t put him above the truth. We can’t be ashamed to say that he failed in many ways, in many aspects. I’m not gonna sign up to do any damn thing with anyone who is dishonest. He was a good president but could’ve been a great, transformative president. He wasn’t. I think he’s too soft.",11RhKDWsS8,8
"'Deeply, deeply let us down'
Riiiight... You're lost?",11RhKDWsS8,1
"He didn't let me down! He pleased me more than you will ever know. The Donald is a patriot a fighter but Pence, OMG. He is mad at Trump. I can't believe it!",11RhKDWsS8,-2
"In fact, the moaists are walking away with much MORE power than they had before 2016!",11RhKDWsS8,32
"Yes, but he showed us the way. By the end tons of minorities were getting off the plantation and he won in a landslide. That's why they panicked and pulled this off, they were in complete panic. His ideas of limited government, low taxes, less regulation and love of country was winning over nearly 100% minority counties in South Texas, he dominated the Cuban American vote etc. 4 more years and they would have been completely destroyed. If he wasn't so successful they wouldn't have felt the need to do this (and although they knew they'd get away with it, they knew most people with a brain would know).",11RhKDWsS8,2

These people want us dead, they want to flood our neighbourhoods with shitty section 8 housing, fill your town with refugee criminals. They want to take your jobs away, turn your kids trans and gay. Why the fuck are we tolerating this shit for a second?",11RhKDWsS8,3

"If elections are meaningless now, what's the disincentive for the right to not cheat?",11RhKDWsS8,2
"The GOP is just the DNC with a different mascot. The swamp rats in the GOP will just be replaced with new DNC approved swamp rats. The past two years have proven to us that our elections have no meaning. The people in power will put their allies in power, and we have no say in it. The things you say are true though... the democrats are going to have absolute power, and they are going to buttfuck us with it. They will be hated, but it won't matter. They will never relinquish power. They will never be removed from office through use of democracy. This is the end of the Republic. We are now a single party oligarchy that only has the illusion of democracy.",11RhKDWsS8,12
"You are right Trump was part of another faction. The Uniparty had an off shoot when Nixon was elected. The offshoot center around Arthur Finkelstein, Roy Cohn, Roger Stone and some others. Their circle extends to General Flynn, the Kushners the Isreali prime minister and some other billionaires. Roy Cohn built a political empire in New York. Trump was been tight with it for a couple decades at least, he inherited the connections from his father. There is a podcast that covers all this. It is called FTN, you can find it at therightstuff.biz.",11RhKDWsS8,2
"Exactly. We are in shock now, but in reality this was going on for many years. It took a President with dragon energy and brilliant ideas to expose it, that's all. Think about it were any of you ever even slightly excited by those candidates? Trump wasn't in on it. With his rock star persona, if he just played along more with the elites, at least to some degree, combined with the patriotism thing he would have won easily. Instead he went all in on cleaning it up. You could argue if he went for say 50% cleanup it would still have been much better than the others would do and maybe that's an option. I mean he could have for example played nice with the drug companies then in term 2 gone after lower prices.",11RhKDWsS8,2
"Bullshit. They now control who gets voted in and who not. Only deep state plants will win ""elections"" in the future. Might as well wipe your ass with your ""vote"".",11RhKDWsS8,10

We need an organization that focuses on winnable primary challenges. It would be helpful if the Trump family put it together. If they don't then someone else with have to do it.,11RhKDWsS8,0
"The logic of voting for the least worst in the general elections still holds whether we like it to or not. Our leverage over the party is in the primaries. Only there. (Not voting and 3rd parties have never worked. We have a rich history from which to safely draw that conclusion.) But, of course, I'm only talking about electoral political efforts. You are right about energy of the movement. The rally yesterday was significant in showing this. We aren't going anywhere. We can really make ourselves a pain in the ass of the establishment.",11RhKDWsS8,1
"I think it's better if only our guys get support. If they lose the primary, we don't show up for the establishment republican. They'll fold very quickly with that strategy. Otherwise you're just rewarding establishment traitors.",11RhKDWsS8,1
"That is something that Trump could help to advocate a move towards. I mean honestly, I keep seeing people suggesting we primary and purge out the republican RINOs. That's not only a huge amount of work, its just not going to happen. It's corrupt and controlled all the way to the top. Any grassroots or decent patriot people Trump stumped for during his tenure were near always robbed during their elections. And anyone we do manage to get in will just be told to shut up and get in line by the GOP establishment. Just like the dems do. If they don't sell out first anyway. The only route is to start fresh with our own team that answers to us. I think we have a good chance of doing it. After seeing the republicans commit political suicide on the 6th a LOT of people are ready to drop them. Heck even old boomer republicans have had enough.",11RhKDWsS8,1
Third parties never work. Primary challenges are sometimes successful.,11RhKDWsS8,0
"but burning the party to the ground, has that ever been tried? for now on, if ypu lose the primary to RINO, he loses the general to the D. Watch how quickly they come scurrying back when the Ds have a supermajority and the donors all go straight to the Ds. the only line, is where they have enough tto amend the constitution in the senate, that is truly scary",11RhKDWsS8,3
They can amend the constitution all they want. The new rules won't be followed by anyone willing to fight dirty. Hell what stops us from collapsing the entire government through noncompliance? Doing nothing is a powerful thing sometimes.,11RhKDWsS8,6
"There have been major overhauls that accompanied voter coalition realignments. Whigs morphed into Republicans. Federalists morphed into National Republicans. These were top-down efforts. Not grassroots efforts to pressure one party's elites into being better. The problem is that many of the worse Rs just don't care that much about losing. Threatening to not vote in the general just doesn't exert any leverage. And I have never seen Rs change their policies or priorities following a low turnout in a general election. E.g. establishment Rs actually got worse after the 1992, 1996 elections involving Perot peeling off populists. We can stop some of the bad ones from getting the nomination. That's were we still have a voice. Again, I'm only talking about our voice in electoral politics.",11RhKDWsS8,2
"Nothing is going to happen Accept that the snakes are deep and IF something cool happens Jan20 cool. This will hurt much less if you prepare now. Nancy and Co just wrote up articles of impeachment plus some republicans today after what ""happened yesterday"". I believe he kind of is throwing us under the bus so he can save his ass. ""Violence"" and ""prosecuted"". Maybe he had a plan but if they impeach his ass its game over. Maybe this is a way to keep the wolfs off his back and stay Pres until the 20th so he can finish the fight. Or maybe he just doesn't want to go out like this by being thrown out. Who knows. But bottom line, YOU and your mental health, close the books now so if the fraud becomes a reality on the 20th it wont kill you and we turn into those loser Hillary fans. If Trump still pulls shit off then its a bonus.",11RhKDWsS8,25
"My guess is he dind't expect the Pence betrayal and that was his last card. He literally had nobody to listen to him or have his back. There is nothing BUT the Swamp so what could he do? There is no fixing this anymore, the government had to be overthrown and nobody has the guts to do that.",11RhKDWsS8,11
"Yea, after all that happened and seeing this video of him basically conceding the only thing I can come up with is that 1/6 was about showing the deep state that Trump had the crowds and maybe use that as a last barganing chip if Pence didn't come trough so him and his family are not prosecuted. Maybe they force him to shake hands with Biden and they dance him around like a trained monkey. Not that they care about what we think, but more to humiliate him and us because they're evil vindictive swamp creatures. I feel completely helpless.",11RhKDWsS8,5

And to praise the people who murdered several of his supporters as HEROES. He fucking betrayed all his supporters. He did exactly to us what Pence did to him.,11RhKDWsS8,3

They really would have.,11RhKDWsS8,1
"But that clearly isn't what Trump wanted. Look, the Left is vicious, but we live to fight another day. Be the bigger man, and we will prevail.

Don't overreact as though the World is ending.",11RhKDWsS8,-7
"What's that saying about democracy being mob rule? Those new Senators and Congressmen and women will be fighting against a massive majority against them within both their own party and the opposing party.

Back the Blue has quickly turned to Fuck the blue. So now you are hated on both sides because you were cowards and betrayed us all when we went out of our way to support you when they wanted you all defunded. Now you get no help. If Antifa is stomping your skull through a sidewalk, we just might join in on the fun. Remember that when you are down to your final seconds of life someday.

The truth is, when you do anything, the people who are natural leaders end up leading. But you can't skip that step of doing things in an amateur way. Do It Yourself. 10 friends out pamphleting is more worthwhile than spending years on the internet waiting for an organization that transforms a million do-nothings into a machine.",11RhKDWsS8,13
absolutely true and deserves more magic updoots,11RhKDWsS8,5
Modern antifa is anything but spontaneous. They are well organized and well funded by the likes of Soros. They come straight out of the communists who terrorized Europe in the early 20th century. We do need a grass roots effort and we need to get a lot smarter. Being lured by people with loud speakers to storm the Capitol is not the kind of smart I'm talking about.,11RhKDWsS8,4
"Oh, they're organised now. But the initial mobs were simply far leftists who got together at universities. The Soros types just cultivated them once they noticed them.",11RhKDWsS8,1
Our organization is that we are all Patriots. We have the knowledge against who is the enemy. What they do. How they act. What they say. that is why the militia is enshrined in the second amendment. no rank or structure. main goal: defeat tyranny.,11RhKDWsS8,5
"This a true, and the organization should require consistency from it's members. Since we don't have that yet, I suggest joining some local conservative groups. Don't worry if they are lame establishment outfits. Seek out other Trump supporters and go from there.",11RhKDWsS8,3

"Interesting take from greatawakening.win: ""The heinous attack on the United States Capitol"" Who attacked? This was a routine protest. It's happened many times before in history. What about the traitors who declared war on us yesterday? That was a heinous attack on our freedom, and they also killed a patriot. ""I immediately deployed the National Guard"" This is contrary to what the media told us. He's saying they lied, he deployed the NG which is in accordance with what we would expect and again reveals the lies of MSM. ""The infiltrators have defiled the seat of Democracy"" Seats are commonly used as a term to describe a Congress person's actual spot in the Congress. ""To those who broke the law, you will pay"" The acceptance of Biden was totally unconstitutional, not to mention it finished on Jan 7th, which is passed the constitutional due date. ""My campaign vigorously pursued every LEGAL avenue"" In other words, I tried to do this the right way. I tried to use the courts. I am no longer capable of this, and will now overstep the courts. ""I was fighting to defend Democracy"" What he as about to do may be considered undemocratic as it was when Lincoln said enacted insurrection, but Lincoln also said although he knew it may be somewhat unconstitutional, it had to be done. ""A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan 20th"" Again no mention of Biden, anywhere. Not one. Why wouldn't he say 'I will be transitioning power to Biden' if he were actually to quit. ""Smooth Orderly and Seamless transition of power"" SOS transition of power. ""A renewed emphasis on the civic values of PATRIOTISM and FAITH"" These are the values that we already hold, and he tells us to have faith. ""Serving as your President HAS been the greatest honour of my lifetime"" Not was, but has. And will continue to be. ""TO ALL MY WONDERFUL SUPPORTERS, I KNOW YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR INCREDIBLE JOURNEY IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING"". Speaks for itself. Sting operation is live.",11RhKDWsS8,3
Yup. Pretty much. People are fair being pissed off.,11RhKDWsS8,0
"Okay so correction: Just because he said ""Come join me"" and ""it's going to get wild"" was NOT a call to action as if it was the end. He was merely doing that so you can see and hear firsthand how the fix was going to take place and what would happen once they infiltrated us from within. This was by NO MEANS a symbol of action for us to take; only you and so many people believed that. Think of it as the bargaining chip process. The elites now know that Trump has the multitudes in the palm of his hands and if he really...REALLY wanted something to pop off, all he'd have to do is say ""come join me"" again and it'll be on. We have less than two weeks of more things to come out for example the Italy fraud was released on video and the EO as released and you're giving up this early?",11RhKDWsS8,0
"Except it would also take brains to comprehend that this was never going to be a call to arms to attack the capitol nor to attack the LEGAL end of the system. Waters, Schumer, Pelosi have all said the exact same things and only the completely fringed-out of their mind part of their side goes out and do anything. The more moderates and the ones who are still filled with a brain, don't take it literally. The importance of comprehension is a must and we seem to fall on blind loyalty instead of using our God-given brains.",11RhKDWsS8,-6
"Lock Her Up, Trust the plan, Trust Session, Its Time to Pay the Bar Tap, EO, etc. You judge a fruit the tree that it produces, did trump get results yes in a limit capacity. Trump is all about loyalty; instead of digging to find the truth he trust Pence and Pence threw Flynn under the bus. Mark my words; unless Trump has a trump card, which I dont believe so because his political capital is spent, to go after these asshole, there will be salted earth. I was there. He did say to go to the capital, there was honestly a million plus people it was epic. 99.9 Just waited waiting for something. I waited, and waited, waited even more in the cold ass wind on a shitty day. I was on the train the moment he came down the stairs, voted in 2016, gave money in 2020 to campaign and to defense fund. We The People have a right to be upset, angry, and pissed that we are held to impossible standard and to cuck when the moment mattered most, is down right sad. I dont have a lot of money, I believe, I tried to convince other people to vote Trump. Showed them receipts that their life got better - mine did. When the message came, I knew I needed go, so I did - did you? There was not leadership about the event, nothing was managed. This was the biggest crowd Trump ever pulled. The movement of people was biblical; 25-50 people across one street, 100s across the mall, and more on a third street. I have been this for the long haul; you are right the telling moments are always darkest before the light. But, as person that deals with risk, there have been millions of times where the darkness did not break. I pray that I am wrong. I think the deck has all been stack against Trump, Us, and I am not sure what to do next. But, I can tell you there are others like me that have the same opinions. God I hope I am wrong.",11RhKDWsS8,11
"Let's be honest if you actually went down there and thought this was going to be something different than a rally, then you and only you are to blame for not reading what was going to happen. I'm sorry but I can't continue to read comments like this that have people trying to shift the blame from themselves to Trump because you lacked the common sense to read between the lines (not being fiery or anything but let's be blunt honest here). The fact that this was the biggest event and not one other big group like Stop the Steal didn't join in it should've been a red light for everyone of you that this was going to be another rally where he talked about his past accomplishments. I'm starting to think that the reason we have so many losses now is the simple fact that we just don't read between the lines like the Demoncrats do and it shows.",11RhKDWsS8,-6
Wow. How kind. Say that to other million people that did not do a thing. Maybe we keep losing conservatives are too fractured and more than willing to blame other conservatives. Get Bend.,11RhKDWsS8,3
"Democrats read between lines? thats cute. But seriously. ""You and only you are to blame""? Not the corrupt democrats that set this photo-op up in the first place? Stockholm is real and it shows with you. Sure, organization was a problem. It was way to easy for Antifa to bait you into a mistake. Trump didn't fail us. We failed Trump. Take responsibility. We should have been shouting it from the rooftops: ANTIFA WILL TRY SOMETHING. NO VIOLENCE. ITS WHAT THEY WANT. But no, everyone waited till they were there in a place where cell signals were being cut, streams were being censored and no one could figure out whats going on in the chaos. We definitely saw this coming. We didn't broadcast this possibility to everyone planning to go.",11RhKDWsS8,1
"Trump gave up, so what do you expect people to do? Storm the white house? It's over, they control everything.",11RhKDWsS8,5
"Cite me actual evidence in any of his speeches that he HIMSELF said ""I concede this election"" or he said ""it's over, folks"" and I'll stop and apologize. You will NOT find it however so what you're doing is dooming and I won't stand for it. Cynicism is one thing but being a debbie-downer and trying to lie is another. Don't be like Pence or the Swamp and lie to me when there's video and audio proof that dispel what you're saying. Man just said ""this is journey is JUST the beginning"" and only thing he said was ""we're tried ALL LEGAL AVENUES..."".",11RhKDWsS8,-3
"He said ""Peaceful transition into a NEW administration"" he also said ""time to heal"" and those who broke in the Capitol ""will pay"" all leftist talking points. It's over Pede. This is no longer about being a doomer or cynic. This is about facing reality. We lost, evil won, the Republic is dead. Trump can't do anything when NOBODY is on his side. I don't blame him. Now we need to brace in for the dark times. We will be completely owned by China in a few days. The constitution is meaningless, the law is meaningless, voting is just for show. There's nothing left we can do because the entire establishment is swamp.",11RhKDWsS8,14
"I will also say, I genuine believe that Trump and the military have the Frankfurt servers from the CIA. I genuine believe that Nashville was a military operation. I genuine believe that Dems will go scorched earth. I pray that trump has his trump card and he can USE the card. I pray that I can find the courage to continue to fight the good fight. I am both ashamed of this Country that we let things get so easier for cities that people became pussies, and in the same note I am extremely proud that people showed up for Trump, and the republic, and for people like you that are here. I have been in this digital battle for a very long time. I have always known that the police are the standing army Washington warned about, before BLM before covid lockdowns.",11RhKDWsS8,2
"He said come for a rally. If people interpreted that to mean more than he said, that's not his fault.",11RhKDWsS8,-6
I was there. There was no leadership at the event. No plan. AJ did he best but his bull horn wasnt loud enough.,11RhKDWsS8,9

"They want to stop him from ever running again, for historic posterity, and if they could arrest him they would.",11RhKDWsS8,27
BS. That cant be the reason... there is no way he gets the support again if he runs again in 2024. I think it is a valid question why on earth are they trying to impeach him when there are legit 13 Days left to his presidency?,11RhKDWsS8,11
"Exactly, in those 4 years they can change all the rules so they can cheat ever more while rubbing their ball sacks in our faces... I believe it must be, as Rush said, because they are fucking afraid of him, of what he knows, of what he can still do to them in that time frame.",11RhKDWsS8,11
They control the media the courts and social networks. What would they have to be afraid of??? They're untouchable and Trump couldn't do anything as President. As a regular guy he's going to suicide with two shots on the back of his head.,11RhKDWsS8,1
Because they want to send a message,11RhKDWsS8,6
"Nope. Because a bigger message would be sending him to jail. Impeaching does not make this process any faster, it adds nothing to their political advantage it would only be symbolic... and by now we should realise that is not what democrats do.. they dont send messages because their goal is to take action and through acting you send a message, not by meaninglessly impeaching him in the last 13 days. I doubt they even have the time to set this all up... what im trying to say is that a message is only a message if it is bound to actions too, otherwise who cares about the impeachment if the bigger story would be sending trump to jail. When he leaves office it is basically the same as „impeachment“ and it gives them a bigger focus on actually going for DJT by taking REAL action. If they impeach now they have to worry with a lot of backlash that would only slow their process down, they dont want that, thus why mike pence (mf traitor) did not answer to pelosis call for 25.",11RhKDWsS8,-2
They don't want him to run in 2024. I understand that its all rigged but they just don't want the problems he causes for them.,11RhKDWsS8,2
"As David Plouffe tweeted back in 2015 ""It is not enough to defeat Donald Trump, He must be thoroughly destroyed so his kind will never rise again."" We are his kind, and they want to be sure, we never rise as we did first in 2010 with the TEA Party, then again by electing Donald Trump. They are goiing to do everything they can to destroy Trump, his family, all his staffers, and all his supporters so the survivors are so demoralized, we wont fight back when they come to round us up. Sadly, many have fallen for it.",11RhKDWsS8,4
They're building him a bridge to retreat across and giving him a reason to take it.,11RhKDWsS8,1
They may. He probably conceded in the hopes they won't. But in actuality it will turn off many of his supporters and make his arrest more likely,11RhKDWsS8,-4
"This is true. If he fought with us, we wouldn't let a hand be laid on him. Throw your own people under the bus? How can I defend you now? He could have said ""BLM and Antifa caused deaths and burning nation-wide"" Goddamnit what the fuck dude.",11RhKDWsS8,3
"YOU MEAN LIKE WHAT THE FUCK HE WAS SAYING THE WHOLE TIME? YOU MEAN LIKE WHAT WAS BEING SAID IN THE RALLY? ""Could have said"" my ass. Wait the full duration. Don't be the dick that feeds down midlane because you had a bad game and want to blame your team. You're making it worse.",11RhKDWsS8,0
I do not know why people are down voting you this is the truth.,11RhKDWsS8,2
"I agree with this. I believe four times today, Trump or people close to Trump have made statements regarding the ORDERLY transition of power and all I'm seeing is people quoting ""peaceful"" transition of power. Words are incredibly important right now, as you can tell from the way that in every single thread on here, people are trying to interpret specific words or comments that Trump has made. If this really is the end for Trump, so be it.",11RhKDWsS8,20

"So far, we haven't really seen Any kind of trick that Trump might have had up his sleeve. This is incredibly rare for Trump, it's not what he does. I think there's much, much, more to come and the next few days are going to be exhausting.",11RhKDWsS8,7
"The big problem with believing that is that you're going to be even more devastated on the 20th. Some of the weaker pedes among us might off themselves. But if they can understand what reality is now, and what I've understood ever since the betrayal by the Supreme Court, then it won't affect them as much. If there's ever going to be some sort of positive change, we need everyone alive and grounded in reality. So join us, here, in reality.",11RhKDWsS8,7
"I don't disagree. I just think this whole thing has been so... dull. We just took loss after loss and kept getting teased with wins, and they never arrived, and we're still being teased.

He started MAGA and he really did create an amazing movement. It's always been about us and the USA. What we do with it now matters. It must happen at the state and local levels first.,11RhKDWsS8,2
Care to elaborate on the different meanings? What is orderly transition vs peaceful transition?,11RhKDWsS8,1
"""The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 provides the current mechanisms to facilitate an orderly and peaceful transition of power. Under existing federal law and custom, the major-party presidential candidates receive classified national security briefings once their nomination is formalized by their party."" A lot of things reference ""peaceful"" transition of power. Trump and his associates today and recently have been leaving that part out. I'm not suggesting what it might mean because I honestly don't know. I just think the language is intentional. Definition of orderly: neatly and methodically arranged. I'm not encouraging anyone to think into it too much but they're obviously being intentional with their words.",11RhKDWsS8,1
"I am hearing reports of the white house staff wanting to transition and ""Several high-ranking administration officials are resigning"". If Trump team is quitting then he is alone. Kayleigh mos def looked like she was crying.",11RhKDWsS8,2

"Nobody cares, we won't have rights anymore and when we're all starving under communism and fearing for our lives who's going to stand up? If we didn't do anything but get our asses kicked yesterday when we where a million strong what do you think we're going to do now?",11RhKDWsS8,0

"Looked at their map, and if every state that is pending approves it, we'll be at the 34 necessary. Unfortunately, 38 states have to agree to any change, which probably won't happen",11RhKDWsS8,1
"You mean the republican state legislatures? Those super reliable republicans. Yep, that'll save us. The simple fact is, democracy is the problem. Contrary to serving as a safeguard against the elite, it is a tool of them. The country needs to be dissolved and completely reformed, minus quite a few corrupt Minecraft characters.",11RhKDWsS8,18
"While I'm down for a total reboot, we have to play with the cards we've been dealt. The Republicans have the fire under their feet now and never want this to happen again. Let's make the best use of this crisis like the Left would.",11RhKDWsS8,1
The Republicans are part of the problem at this point.,11RhKDWsS8,15
"Which is why we need to primary them into the ground. We know who our enemies are now—let's use this as an opportunity to purge the RNC, not to give up.",11RhKDWsS8,0
"Primary them.. so a) you want to stay in the GOP, and b) believe your vote actually matters with rigged elections Woo trump 2024, right?",11RhKDWsS8,4
Loeffler and Perdue just rolled over. I wouldn't say they had a fire,11RhKDWsS8,4
"I'm talking about state legislatures, but I agree. And now we have an opportunity to primary all traitors and rebuild this party from the ground up.",11RhKDWsS8,0
GOP rigs the primaries too,11RhKDWsS8,2
"You will die disappointed waiting for Republicans to save you. They are bought by the same elite that run the Democrats. Republican party politics is a blind alley for the enemies of oligarchy to go down. If we have any hope we have to either, bury the Republican party or break away.",11RhKDWsS8,1
"We need to start the O'Neill Cylinders ASAP, and start migrating to another solar system. If they want to continue this stupid path America will just go where we won't be held back.",11RhKDWsS8,1
You somehow have the illusion that we have elections in this conquered territory,11RhKDWsS8,11
"Perhaps. Silver lining: State legislatures have been spurred to implement election reform. If we harp on them, the Left may never win an election in this nation again. How will that help? Democrats just changed the election rules outside of the legal process, and the courts let them get away with it.",11RhKDWsS8,10
Make them idiot-proof. Barnes talked a bit about the best salvaging we can do in this situation in yesterday's podcast with Viva Frei. We need to use this crisis to the best of our ability.,11RhKDWsS8,1
"You can't make ""idiot proof"" laws if they ignore the law entirely. I hope you're right though. Trust me I do.",11RhKDWsS8,5
"Perhaps. Silver lining: State legislatures have been spurred to implement election reform. Counterpoint: What if the left ""gives"" us full voter ID everywhere, but still fucks with votes via machines, adjudicating, etc, but gets to claim ""see, we even did voter ID, totally legit elections!""",11RhKDWsS8,4
One step at a time. Election reform needs to detail how we conduct election beyond just ID.,11RhKDWsS8,0
"Where we're going, we won't need voters.",11RhKDWsS8,16
"If everyone was as defeatist as this, Trump would never have made it out of the primaries.",11RhKDWsS8,6
"Don't you understand, you fool? They have stolen this election. There is no future elections. Civil War or death.",11RhKDWsS8,21
"I haven't heard Rosie odonald sing yet, have you?",11RhKDWsS8,0
Good luck with that.,11RhKDWsS8,-4
"They never committed mass voter fraud, got caught, and then still won the election before. We thought we had a voice, we don't anymore.",11RhKDWsS8,19
Never did. At this point I honestly didn't think they had to cheat in 2016 to any kind of level and Trump's campaign did an amazing job of playing the Electoral game.,11RhKDWsS8,1
Or they cheated & were thwarted by an adversarial group... Perhaps Dam Rodgers from the NSA?...,11RhKDWsS8,0
Then why weren't they prepared for this time?,11RhKDWsS8,0
"Not defeatist, realist.",11RhKDWsS8,14
It looks like the soap box is officially over. The jury box said they didn't have standing to decide the leader of the free world. So here we are!,11RhKDWsS8,3
I think they rigged 2016 to have Trump win and then use Russiagate to get him out. I think Hillary was a decoy too. FBI could have gotten her out and someone else in. Only issue is Trump beat Russiagate and so they just rigged the election in Biden's favor and will get him out and someone else in that they actually want and Biden is a decoy. We have no control as Americans.,11RhKDWsS8,3
"Why would they fix it to put Trump into office just to smear him for years & maybe remove him from office while taking the risk of him dismantling their control?
Makes no sense...
It is much more plausible that they tried to cheat & the NSA prevented the fraud just enough for a Trump win...",11RhKDWsS8,3
"To even more demoralize the patriots who would support him and are against their agenda. Another theory i heard was Obama hates Hillary he threw her under the bus and didn’t let Dominion cheat her to victory. Obama had his shadow government in place, it was easy to subvert Trump at every step.",11RhKDWsS8,0
We're going to need a Pinochet to set things right.,11RhKDWsS8,2
There was no surveillance state or police state in 1776. Odds are infinitely stacked against us this time,11RhKDWsS8,45
"This. Revolutionary times had a level of surveillance that is only now becoming realized again. Yes, there was no Internet, but there were as you said soldiers everywhere. The thing about technology is that it can be a curse or a blessing. Right now, it is working as a curse to us, with the level of control they have over everything. We can harness technology and use it in our own way. I am working on a communications system that can be used by patriots to communicate either over existing infrastructure as securely as possible, or allow for the creation of grassroots infrastructure (think cat5 cables in the woods). It will function as a telephone system and communications messageboard, that can work over analog or digital lines. It will be a mix of ""obsolete"" technology and modern security methods that may not be pretty like this site, but will be resilient, secure, and adaptable, something we need more. (throwaway account of 5-year TD/TDW user)",11RhKDWsS8,8
You are talking about an actual Mesh network then.,11RhKDWsS8,1
"Yes, and no. The initial network will operate using the public internet infrastructure but will use direct IPs instead of DNS. Clients will connect to local servers and local servers will communicate with each other using a central server (ideally) or directly to each other. (image) In a true SHTF, the servers can be connected to each other directly with cat5 cabling and analog data transmission (modems). Ethernet signals are not capable of running over long long distances without expensive amplifiers. Telephone amps can be made with under $100 in parts.",11RhKDWsS8,1
Would lasers work in this case with the blue spectrum or would that be just too noticeable.,11RhKDWsS8,0
There is and will always be a way brother.,11RhKDWsS8,15
Those Afghan forces have been battling 2 major superpowers for decades. There is a way.,11RhKDWsS8,4
"Dude, this comparison isn’t cognate with one another, Afghanistan is a largely mono-cultural society, with downright primitive infrastructure, no media domination, and no major resources making it worthy of conquest. The major reason it survived conquest over the years, is because it simply wasn’t worth conquering.",11RhKDWsS8,4
This barren desert scape is mine! *sticks flag in ground*,11RhKDWsS8,1
I’m pretty sure the odds back then for the revolutionist were still worse back then lol.,11RhKDWsS8,9
"The Internet has given us the ability to communicate like never before. But once our ability to assemble and speak freely online is hindered, it's 1984 and there's no way out of it. I was lead to believe the 2020 was our final stand, yet it was only the beginning.",11RhKDWsS8,5
Look at the people who will be in charge of the police state. These aren't the iron willed apparatchiks from 1984. They are deranged LGBT punks. They don't know their ass from a whole in the ground.,11RhKDWsS8,3
Not to mention Kerry and the rest of the Obama and Bush-era swamp cast are making a return. Dark days ahead.,11RhKDWsS8,4
Do you really think the LGBT punks are acting on their own volition vs being guided by nefarious actors behind the scenes? They are 'useful idiots'...,11RhKDWsS8,3
"They had the backing of France, Spain, and the Dutch. Who tf will back us?",11RhKDWsS8,3
Russia has been backing us this entire time.,11RhKDWsS8,1
Make no mistake .... that is the only solution,11RhKDWsS8,2
The problem is that it seems like there aren't men like that anymore.,11RhKDWsS8,2
And the intelligence agencies.,11RhKDWsS8,18
And Fortune 500 companies,11RhKDWsS8,6
& an army of brainwashed sheep.,11RhKDWsS8,3
great then we can lash out in every direction sure to strike an enemy sounds fun,11RhKDWsS8,6
So fucking what. The colonists didn't control the internet back in the day either.,11RhKDWsS8,4
"Many enemies, much honor.",11RhKDWsS8,1
"They have social media, that’s not owning the internet",11RhKDWsS8,0
"Who do you think controls the infrastructure?
Those same companies that threatened to deplatform us just yesterday...",11RhKDWsS8,4
are there international servers we can use that dont ban?,11RhKDWsS8,2
"Yeah, and we are now making our own sites. So their threats to de platform will only work for so long.",11RhKDWsS8,-1
Infrastructure. Meaning the people who host the sites. Don't be naive.,11RhKDWsS8,1
I’m not. And they don’t host all of them.,11RhKDWsS8,0
"The ones who dont bend the knee, only havent because they havent been noticed. They crooks have already been using the excuse you know they're gonna use to take sites down: ""Encouraging violence"". But I do apologize for calling you names. I'm pissed off.",11RhKDWsS8,0
"Only the voice that sounds like a clap of thunder. I WILL ABSOLUTELY DIE BEFORE I WILL EVER FOLLOW A SINGLE DIRECTIVE FROM THESE GLOBALIST DEMONS I DON'T USE FOUL LANGUAGE BUT FUCK THE PEDO AND THE HO, FUCK THEM AND EVERYTHING THEY STAND FOR",11RhKDWsS8,13
"""lets not vote in GA to teach the GOP a lesson"" lol.",11RhKDWsS8,9
"""You should just vote out the vote fraud"" ok",11RhKDWsS8,51
Why does voting matter anymore when they can make the numbers whatever they want them to be?,11RhKDWsS8,37
"Oh, sorry, I’ll just get 700 trillion Americans to vote for our candidate next time. Trump had the biggest support a MAGA candidate will ever have in 2020. He won blue and swing states by double-digits on 11/3 before they started frauding. It will never be a bigger landslide than that. There is 0 chance to overcome this fraud by numbers if it didn’t happen in 2020. They will just continue to refine their techniques as well. The courts gave them precedent to get away with it untouched.",11RhKDWsS8,13
"Dude you don’t know that. No one knows that. No one saw Trump coming and no one expected him to gain the support he did. You people really need to stop bitching. Trump accomplishing what he did means we know this is possible. If it’s possible, then it can be done again. Hell it may even be outperformed. That’s what human nature has always been about. What you think people in sports looked back at past athletes and said, “Well that guy was too good. Shouldn’t even try to top that!” If we know they cheated we need to put all our effort shine proving it and never letting up. Them getting away with it now isn’t an excuse to let them get away with it later. If you want to quit then quit. Honestly I’m getting tired of listening to y’all cry.",11RhKDWsS8,-8
They were asleep at the wheel in 2016 and never thought Trump had a chance. They didn't make the same mistake this time around and we were to naïve to think it would happen.,11RhKDWsS8,6
"They did honestly, because they clearly didn’t expect the turn out to happen the way it did. That’s why they stopped counting votes. I’m surprised y’all keep forgetting this. No one was thinking they’d be asleep at the wheel. We all knew they would play dirty tricks to win. If you didn’t you probably just weren’t paying attention man.",11RhKDWsS8,0
"Honestly, you're the one that is quitting & delusional if you think there will ever be a fair/winnable election after this - they will never allow it to occur again. But yeah, sure, out-vote the dominion vote flipping machines in 2024, that's a sure bet!",11RhKDWsS8,5
"Well dude...I don’t think I could be quitting if I’m still...going so....anyway I never said anything about a fair election. But I doubt they won’t be winnable. Again this election alone shows that. Now as I said, if you want to quit or not vote that’s your choice. 🤷🏾‍♂️",11RhKDWsS8,-3
It doesn't matter if their method is flawed if there is nobody willing to punish them for it. We have now been shown that the corruption is at all levels of government and that they are all above the law. All legal means of fighting have been exhausted.,11RhKDWsS8,2
"It does matter, because we can find the holes in it. Someone not being there to punish them now doesn’t mean that won’t change in the future. But we need to stay focused on proving it.",11RhKDWsS8,-2
"Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona have a lot of work to do. Get involved at what ever level you can.",11RhKDWsS8,8
DeSantis should run elections for the entire country lol,11RhKDWsS8,3

"They say their vote ""doesn't count"" but how did we prove election fraud? VOTING IN FUCKING PERSON.",11RhKDWsS8,-1
Was never going to be proven. The poof is the well known facts that Straight up bullshit. Never forget. Never forget.,11RhKDWsS8,5
"My pede, I'm with you on the mail in voting. I would bet my life savings Trump wins without the mail in fraud. This will be the new ""nOrMaL"" now though. Now that they have all the power we are FUCKED. What do you suggest we do?? Riots? That's what CNN was for.. We need a leader to show the masses the way.",11RhKDWsS8,1

"He started a movement and was surrounded by hyenas the whole time. As shitty as this is now, there is a silver lining. If Trump won, his guidance would keep the Republican party alive, on life support. Now is the time to reorganize under a new America first party, and to let Romney's RNC finally die. We need to focus on ensuring change at the local levels, and then state levels. We need to do this so the next true Maga candidate can have true allies, and a sure footing. The swamp is a lot deeper than we thought",11RhKDWsS8,140
You say that as if we’re not about to be over run with commies. Elections are over bud,11RhKDWsS8,70

"In fairness, he's not dooming; just making an observation. We can't make plans if we don't acknowledge reality.",11RhKDWsS8,21
"Agreed. Anyone that this 'we will vote them out next time, pedes!' is absolutely delusional & denying the reality of what occurred in 2018 & 2020 (+ God knows how many other prior elections)...",11RhKDWsS8,4
Before Trump the last elections were Obama vs Romney and Obama vs McCain. And pedes still DONT GET IT. We never had a choice until Trump. Trump was a glitch and they fixed the glitch.,11RhKDWsS8,2
"We need to do what they did. They got in and fucked with election laws at the state and local level and that ruined us. The Dems control the federal government, but we just had a good election in the state houses and we're going to have redistricting done. We can fix the mess in the states and municipalities where this fraud began in the first place. Cut the monster off at its roots, and then challenge them in an election on equal footing.",11RhKDWsS8,1
Marxists are already here in full force bud,11RhKDWsS8,6
Not if we Athens TN across the entire Country.,11RhKDWsS8,3
"That is an interesting thought for 2022. We need to start planning to primary the RINOs NOW, and simultaneously plan an Athens strategy for both the primaries and the 2022 general. There need to be patriots outside every ballot counting facility for all of election day, waiting. We need to have on-the-ground leadership and communication between all the local groups. We should have had a strategy in place before hand, I think that was our biggest mistake. If there were patriots OTG on Nov 4th that were preparing for it, I think we potentially could have stopped it then. We did everything we could afterwards, so credit to everybody here for fighting to the end.",11RhKDWsS8,2
Fuck that. It’s all rigged; Which part don’t people get? R-I-G-G-E-D Fuck 2022,11RhKDWsS8,1

"The commies have spent all their energy fighting Trump. Fighting truth from spreading. Fighting people from enjoying their lives. They are exhausted from fighting for so long. But we’re fresh. I think the general public is tired of fighting. The police are tired of fighting the left & right. Politicians are tired. Hell, Biden is tired and he hasn’t even become president yet. Take solace my friend. Fear not. Process the pain, let it out. Then rise calmer, stronger, and more focused than ever. Like Trump would want you to.",11RhKDWsS8,2
The Left wants you to believe that.,11RhKDWsS8,0
Most Trump supporters are not even republicans and we have no interest in joining that party or “fixing” it,11RhKDWsS8,33
"Takes a special man to lead and fight to the very, bitter end. I am not a registered Republican, nor Democrat. I probably wouldn't register with a new party that has no hope of overcoming 4 AM ballot stuffing. The best course of action is hard red states coming together and seceding, and rebuilding in the nation that comes from that. Only way I can see leadership sprouting up through this propagandist state we live in.",11RhKDWsS8,9
Keep alive the same political party that backstabbed him?,11RhKDWsS8,12
Yes in the same way he supported those ass hats in Georgia. Not because he really wanted to but because it was his only choice for somewhat of an ally. Now we have to rebuild so our next candidate isn't stuck compromising for shitty allies,11RhKDWsS8,1
"This. A third party is not feasible sadly. The GOP politicians may be extremely anti-Trump, but the populous is not. It would be much easier to raise hell within the GOP and primary out the House in 2022 (with an election securing strategy along the lines of Athens, TN). After the spending ""stimulus"" bill circus, I think it will be easy to convince lay-GOP to primary the whole House.",11RhKDWsS8,-3
Primary them then.,11RhKDWsS8,-1
Uhh....this is not about the Republican Party,11RhKDWsS8,7
There is no Republican Party.,11RhKDWsS8,7
Long live the Patriots,11RhKDWsS8,4
Movement didn't start w/Trump...goes back to the Tea Party and just grew from there. Trump recognized and capitalized brilliantly. Someone had better have been taking notes. Desantis appears to have.,11RhKDWsS8,106
And Tea Party goes back to the Ron Paul Revolution.,11RhKDWsS8,59
"Maaany of us got dunked in the red pill tank first with Ron Paul in 2008. It has colored my political understanding and outlook ever since, and honestly may have saved my life because I was young then. I could have ended up an uncritically thinking NPC, like some of my friends. DJT has done the same and much, much more. May we honor their service by keeping the fight alive.",11RhKDWsS8,22
"My bro was always raving about Ron Paul and I never understood why. I now know why - I've been conservative since the beginning, but I never got truly redpilled until Trump came around.",11RhKDWsS8,7
"I used to like Ron Paul, he's the only person I voted for in the past besides Trump (write-in). Seeing his son yesterday sealed the deal for me that he was controlled opposition to keep us placated & think that we had a champion in the halls of congress.

If you lived in Texas pre-2016 you already knew that about cruz.,11RhKDWsS8,8
IT IS HONESTLY TIME FOR A NEW PARTY. EVERYONE IS ABSOLUTELY SICK OF THE UNI-PARTY. ITS NOT JUST US. IT IS EVERYONE. DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WANT TO VOTE FOR PELOSI? GOOD GOD SHE LOOKS LIKE DEATH.

Voted for him,11RhKDWsS8,1
Pretty much.. he had serious momentum after 1992 and blew it. If he hadn't have quit the 92 race midway he woulda gotten over 25% at least. The country woulda been better off with him. No Nafta.,11RhKDWsS8,0

"They're talking of impeaching him. Do you really want that to happen? He's making this statement to try to stave that off. The MSM has made this thing out to be worse than 9/11. If he had any loyalists left in his inner circle and the time, he might be able to play the long game and ultimately correct the narrative. But now, if he comes out on his own and says ""You know, I agree with the sentiment those protesters had"", he'd be gone in the morning. What he said and what Kayleigh said are not designed for us, they are designed for the rabid media and the leftists scumbags that want to remove him. It's PR, and it's a nasty game.",11RhKDWsS8,-2
Thank god someone said it. We can’t expect him to do literally everything when he has NO support in government. The amount of people turning on him today is fucking sickening.,11RhKDWsS8,69
"And shills. I think we had FBI informants here encouraging folks to bring guns to DC and then pushing people to start something and I know people were frustrated and pissed, but without a plan we played right into their hands. Remember Christ and we win this by being lighthearted, laughing, memes and winning over folks that felt horrified by what the left was pushing as they're the party of Antifa and BLM's violent city burnings. Still our struggle is so much harder for every person that watches the MSM. I felt fine today, but yesterday I was furious that we were infiltrated and I suspect this forum was infiltrated for weeks and months to goad folks into doing stupid shit even if their heart was in the right place.",11RhKDWsS8,3

I think patriots would have felt better about themselves had they not been infiltrated by left wing folks and steered into a trap.,11RhKDWsS8,-1
"Now that you mentioned it there has been a rise of people supporting violence in the wrong places and the wrong reasons. What happened is what I was afraid of happening to those going. It certainly does explain the quiet that has been going on with Antifa and BLM, and that there was hardly any mention of them in the FBI area as well. Topping that off the media was quiet about them as well which should have been the obvious sign. Feeling really stupid now for not having linking that together. The only options left are taking our states back, removing power from the Federal Government to the States, or things going hot. Getting our states back and removing Federal Government influence in our states should be the main priority right now until they do a martial lockdown which is going to happen under Biden for one inane reason or another.",11RhKDWsS8,-3

At least it shows who they are really afraid of.,11RhKDWsS8,12
They aren't afraid of Antifa because they're on the same side.,11RhKDWsS8,2
What a fucking ass hat. I was wrong.,11RhKDWsS8,21

There’s not going to be any of that. Biden already said he won’t run twice. Harris is despised and won’t run survive without Biden’s coattails. And AOC is being pushed out by the Dems. The power they have now is temporary.,11RhKDWsS8,2

The dems clearly wanted a woman who was of dark skin. You seriously think if they had that level of control they wouldn’t have just had Khamala dominate from the beginning 🤷🏾‍♂️? Just doesn’t add up.

Once their satanic agenda starts killing everyone left and right, suddenly the mass populace will be begging for us to rush the capital armed. I really don't want to give up on trump.

Nope. In it until god calls me home,11RhKDWsS8,15

"There's a lot of people in here acting like BernieBros from 2016 saying ""bErNiE cAn StIlL wIn!!!!!!!11111!!!"" I appreciate the dedication, but at this point you'[re only lying to yourself. It's no better than the NotMyPresident leftists. The sooner you realize that Biden is going to be inaugurated, the sooner we can work together to fight his administration and do everything we can to ensure that our rights, liberties, and freedoms are protected and Trump's legacy lives on.",11RhKDWsS8,1

"Stop pinning your hopes on what happens at the top and spending all your energy trying to rationalize some way things will work out the way you hoped. You should've already assumed there would be some kind of civil conflict, now assume the communists will be fighting from the more ""legitimized"" position. If your trust the plan LARP does end up yielding fruit and Trump gets inaugurated normally then woohoo.",11RhKDWsS8,2
"Did you not read shit? I'm willing for civil conflict, I don't care about spilling blood. What about you?",11RhKDWsS8,1
Then stop obsessively clinging to super secret plans that will miraculously avoid civil conflict. I've accepted it since Ukraine.,11RhKDWsS8,0

you’re an idiot,11RhKDWsS8,-3
Insanity is doing the same thing over again expecting different results.,11RhKDWsS8,13
You can leave any time,11RhKDWsS8,-1
You let me know when chasing your own tail works out for you.,11RhKDWsS8,5
Dude. He conceded. Stop coping and let's all figure out what our next moves are.,11RhKDWsS8,12
Or you could just hold the line for 13 more days. I can tell you’re young because you’re impatient but Trumps still the president so I suggest you continue to support him. He chose his words very carefully in this speech and it kinda gave me a hard on.,11RhKDWsS8,0
"lol everyone who disagrees must be a kid, Listen, Donald Trump is handing over the US to the CCP. This was his concession speech, it's over for him. But go ahead and cope for 13 more days, make sure to come back to this comment to tell me I was right.",11RhKDWsS8,4
Wait for 13 more days or don't wait for 13 more days. In 13 days you'll be 13 days older either way.,11RhKDWsS8,1
Ok I will and I know it’s really hard right I’m really frustrated too but we haven’t hit the ultimate deadline yet. If you give up the that’s fine just don’t doom please until the fat lady sings then I’ll doom right there with ya.,11RhKDWsS8,1
I'm not giving up at all. I love this country and will continue to fight for it. I just won't pretend that Trump is still in the fight. It's up to us to figure out what to do now and we can't do that if we're still holding onto false hope.,11RhKDWsS8,5
You're pretending he is out of the fight...,11RhKDWsS8,1
That's because I'm not blinded by hope like many are. Biden will be sworn in on the 20th no matter how much we hate it. It's time to start thinking about what we need to do next instead of doing nothing and trusting a plan that never existed.,11RhKDWsS8,0
will you admit it when we do hit the ultimate deadline and nothing happens?,11RhKDWsS8,1
Like I told the other guy that’s when I’ll start dooming but I’ll never accept the results and neither should anyone else who voted for the president.,11RhKDWsS8,0

"Watch his speech again & provide the timestamp where he conceded... I won't hold my breath because I know it didn't happen, doomer.",11RhKDWsS8,0
"He literally says a new administration will be sworn in. You're a full blown retard if you don't think he means Biden. Call me a doomer all you want, in 13 days I'll expect what always happens. You and everyone else will be saying ""ah shucks, I guess the doomers were right"". Every damn time.",11RhKDWsS8,-2
This kind of Bernie can still win level denial is just amazing on TDW. so I guess there is really no difference between extreme ends of two sides. Sad!,11RhKDWsS8,-2
"So when Biden is sworn in on the 20th and Trump no doubt sits at his inauguration are you still going to be holding out and trusting the plan because Trump didn't specifically use the word ""concede""?

I'm going to face reality.",11RhKDWsS8,3

Whatever man. If you can't see the truth then go sit in the corner and trust the plan. Adults are talking here.,11RhKDWsS8,3
Wait... I think you’re the one here who cannot read between the lines. Did he welcome Biden into the White House? I think not. Go sit down until you learn reading comprehension.,11RhKDWsS8,-3

"Saw a ton of shills out at 7am today, a ton, they’re putting in extra time.",11RhKDWsS8,2

"This is what I keep thinking. It's going to be new one way or another. Whatever the current situation is, we had to let it run this far.

And everyone please grow up. This is war and shit happens. Roll with whatever comes our way.",11RhKDWsS8,1
George Washington was viewed as the only person capable of leading the US. People wanted to crown him king. And he resigned. This resignation became the precedent. The US didn’t end with Washington. It had only just begun.,11RhKDWsS8,2

"The Left has been decentralized, in the sense they have multiple groups with multiple leaders each. We can do the same.",11RhKDWsS8,2
Think of it this way....even if Trump did win the left WOULD impeach him a second time and actually have the votes to boot him out. I don't want Trump to lose his second term that might not even last three months the way things are flying now in DC. Let the democrats throw their party and lose seats and let Trump ride their coat tails of failure for a stronger future and pick up the people who want change that fall off. Best news is McConnell won't be in charge anymore at least because of his own selfish actions but he is a loser so maybe he prefers it this way....make more money trying to play the underdog that never wins.,11RhKDWsS8,2
I don't see why they would lose seats. The 2022 Senate race is people who won in 2016.,11RhKDWsS8,0

"Remember, Trump was not a party politician. He highjacked the Republican Party. In the end, it was the Republican Party that betrayed and abandoned him. In doing so, they abandoned us.",11RhKDWsS8,22
"It's not that he threw in the towel, but rather that invited millions of pissed off people to DC, and basically abandon them. WTF did he think was going to happen when left them after his speech with no direction. People didn't show up to go to another Trump rally. The people are tired of the boot on their neck and he bailed on us when we needed him to lead us most.",11RhKDWsS8,18
Where did he throw in the towel??????????????? Get bent,11RhKDWsS8,17
When he told the world that the people who walked through the capital and made a mess of a few desks will be punished,11RhKDWsS8,13
"That's not throwing in the towel. That's saying people who broke the law should be punished. His order was to remain peaceful and respectful of law enforcement. When the commander in chief issues an order and his soldiers disobey, he should not be happy.",11RhKDWsS8,-6

"Like our forefathers did when they decided to say fuck it and go up against the biggest, most successful empire on Earth, right? It's never hopeless and we need to find new ways to win and organize. The best thing we can do is convince the relatives and folks we know the watch the MSM to turn it the fuck off. We can pay for conservative outlets and reporting that deserves our business so the folks can't get deplatformed and we can support conservative businesses that support us. Let's keep it going and not get down from our setbacks. Washington lost plenty of battles, but persisted and won when it counted and that's what we need to do, bounce back and be ready for round 2 and every round after that it takes.",11RhKDWsS8,6
"I'm not trying to get down, but the advances in technology make this situation unique. They're going to put us all away. Look what they did to the veteran in capital. Its not just the swamp, its not just chynah. Its both and one would need to successfully pull off a revolution before fighting chynah.

I’ll never quit. MAGA is a lifestyle.,11RhKDWsS8,3
"How did we quit? We showed up to DC angry and ready to fight, when things got hot he told us to back down. We did, and waited in anticipation for his next plan like good boys. Only to be told we're terrorists and he is conceding, despite yesterday saying he will never concede.",11RhKDWsS8,2

They are still fighting.,11RhKDWsS8,15
It's time for the MAGA Party!!! We will be the new generation of leaders!!!,11RhKDWsS8,13

He wasn't solo. He had us there IN FUCKING D.C. RIGHT THERE.,11RhKDWsS8,12
"It was a beautiful moments, but unfortunately the reality is we weren’t in charge of that situation and Trump is very limited",11RhKDWsS8,-3
"As much as that video pissed me off, it's important for everyone to remember that if the current government is not overthrown he will die in prison with the rest of his family for nonexistent crimes. Assume the military has left him, assume that the only power comes from organization, proceed from there.",11RhKDWsS8,10
"I will repeat this here again... Conceding means accepting that Biden won legitimately. Trump will never concede even in his grave. He will always maintain that he won the election, which we all know he did. However, conceding is different from accepting that he is out of political moves aka ""political checkmate"". So unless Trump still has an ace up his sleeve, it seems this is the end of his fight. He has done all he can and fought to the end. What one sees as the end of the fight, is subjective though. Some people, the end is when hostile uprising option is tried, but it is clear that Trump does not see it this way. Trump only sees the legal means, and once he is out of those, he considers the fight has ended. I hope pedes here don't get too disillusioned with Trump. He is not conceding, but he has fought as much as he could, maybe not as smart as we would want to, but I am 100% certain he was genuinely fighting. Realistically, it does seem to be the end. Is the fight over? 100% NO, but it may lie low for years or even generations until something comes up that triggers a change in American society and mindset. At least now, things are out in the open. People may have to wait for a new champion(s) to rise up or be born.
There will be a lot of grifters for sure. Hopefully, people learn lessons from this and how to organically raise a movement and how to deal with backstabs, internal politics, corruption, etc. Maybe Trump was too clean and wanted to fight everyone at once, hence he failed. Maybe to get rid of corruption, people need to ally with a group of equally corrupt politicians with their own interests. Dunno. The world of politics is really dark and sickening.",11RhKDWsS8,9
Your comment needs way more upvotes. I recommend you make this a brand new post. Very based and logical take on things.,11RhKDWsS8,1
So trump called the national guard on patriots?,11RhKDWsS8,8
He kept telling patriots through tweets and the video to separate themselves from Antifa without actually saying it but unfortunately it did not happen,11RhKDWsS8,-1

No. Patriots followed Antifa in and that’s when the shooting and guns came out.,11RhKDWsS8,0

Are those 17 states going to stand by their words and secede?,11RhKDWsS8,7
I must have missed something. What's the deal with the 17 states?,11RhKDWsS8,3
"Part of the position of the 17 states joined with Texas' lawsuit was that the US constitution does not allow states to violate their own election law, and that if the US doesn't uphold the constitution then maybe they should form a union that does. https://twitter.com/adamkelsey/status/1337549501507264515/photo/1",11RhKDWsS8,5
Ok Thanks pede. I thought maybe something new had come out.,11RhKDWsS8,1
Never once said the word CONCEDE or BIDEN.... hang on for the ride,11RhKDWsS8,6
He said “smooth transition to the next administration “ so that sounds like conceding to me.,11RhKDWsS8,8
"Even if he pulled it off, we still would've needed to reclaim the country, from the bottom up. The left has been chipping away it for a long time. They are fine with incrementalism. They'll push 100 crazy ideas, and if 1 gets through, they see their record as 1-0, not 1-99. And then they push 100 more. We have many ways forward. Attack on all fronts, politically, economically, and culturally. Work to primary and recall as many swine as possible. Primary turnout in midterms is low. There is no reason we can't make a difference there, even with their cheating. Participate at all levels. Yeah, I know voting is a joke, but inroads can be made. Local control is important, as we have seen. Spend, invest, hire and fire based on principles and commit to it. Fuck Chinese products. Help undermine a Biden economy. Homeschool. Teach our history. Hold to your faiths. Dump as much media as possible or create new media. Politics is downstream from culture. Sounds Pollyanna I know, but it's necessary. And of course buy ammo while you can.",11RhKDWsS8,5

"Regarding badmouthing Trump, I am going to repost what I posted elsewhere earlier: All I know is that whatever does happen, I cannot ever see Trump as anything other than an amazing president and American, and I thank him for coming down that escalator and upending his life for us. I know I've read in the past 24 hours some people on here saying otherwise or that he let us down. I understand their frustrations, but that is simply not true regardless of what happens next. This man has been through so much crap and had so many targets on his back, and he's never stopped fighting for us for the past four years... and at some point, which I believe is now, we are the ones that need to do the heavy lifting. And to add on to that, that heavy lifting is going manifest uniquely to every patriot who refuses to give up on the MAGA movement. Protesting, getting involved in their community, running for office, etc. I know this place is called The Donald, and he is a primary symbol of the movement, but it can and will go beyond him. He is the leader, but WE are the movement. We have stepped up in certain ways in the past, and we must continue those efforts and go beyond. Do not despair and do not disengage from politics. That's exactly what they want. And I get it... I want to just forget all about politics after what has transpired... but I know that's a mistake. I truly do believe a third party for the people is needed. Lick your wounds if you must, scream, cry, etc (I know I sure have unleashed a lot of negative emotion the last 24 hours!). That disappointment that some of you feel tonight? It's because you love this country, its people, and our freedoms. Reach into your soul and channel that disappointment into positive momentum. The road was always going to be extremely rocky... even moreso now that they pulled off this steal... but I refuse to give up my country.",11RhKDWsS8,3
Spitting FACTs.... exactly. 45 will eternally be known as the leader of the American freedom movement.

"We are in hibernation ATM. Awaiting new leadership to emerge. IDK what to think nor who to believe, as over the past week I'm living in a state of what is called suspended disbelief. I was there at the Ellipse on the 6th, and on the West Side of the Capitol along with hundreds of thousands of other likeminded patriots. Thus I am here. I changed my party registration for the first time in my lifetime (I have voted R since Reagan in 1980). I have supported TDW's digital soldier effort and met some great people there working night and day for almost a month. Trump said, and I quote him verbatim, on the 6th: Today is not the end. It’s just the beginning. With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that. ...But our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech and others is just getting started. I am not a doomer. But would leave this thought: Trump exposed for everyone to see how compromised the Uniparty is, corrupt to the core, all arrayed against us. Should next week bring a new asterisk president, a key question (which many of us have answered for ourselves already) is whether the R party could be reformed from within, or you just start all over again. I believe the latter is in order - Trump tried, and failed, to reform from within, we saw four years of him battling his own party. Unlike Ross Perot's failed effort that just split the effort throwing power to the other side, this one is demonstrably different. Close to 50% of the population believe fraud occurred. We saw and participated in gigantic rallies. The liberals are scared and doing everything in their power to demonstrate what they are made of. How are we to battle all this? Corrupt to the core, we believe our very existence as a country is at stake, and once having seen it with our own eyes cannot unsee it. One week out, we have Q silent since over a month ago, during a period when they / she / it / he could have had the MOST impact. Rudy, Sidney, Lin, Patrick, all silenced and silent.

This does NOT imply I'm switching to D.",11S0SNEF1s,63
I didn't vote Republican before Trump. No reason to think I will after.,11S0SNEF1s,25
Who will you afterwards? The national libertarians sound just like the democrats do.,11S0SNEF1s,4
"If Trump isn't President in a couple months votes clearly aren't going to matter anyway unless we somehow rebuild the system wholly from the ground up. Why fret over which party your votes are out-frauded by? Were you this upset in 2012 when Romney threw the election? McCain in 2008? Point is I'm waiting for Trump to call it. When he calls it bring on the doom. Until then, no fucking brakes.",11S0SNEF1s,21
"Updooted. The election was stolen in 2012, too, no doubt about it. I think Trump has a whole lot of collected material. We might have another Assange style stituation",11S0SNEF1s,5
Fraud may have happened - but do you think Romney was more popular than Obama?,11S0SNEF1s,3
"I think with Obama's Not-recovery and all his other crap, people decided Romney was a lesser evil. Romney himself shut down campaign weeks before Election Day because the polling had him within a point or two of Obama Obama LOST 3.5M votes in 2012 from 2008.",11S0SNEF1s,1
"With all due respect, the fraud is the issue, not many wanted Romney but given the choice he would have won.",11S0SNEF1s,1
"Really? I’m not American and was young in 2012, but I thought Obama was definitely always considered more popular than Romney.",11S0SNEF1s,1
I was disappointed back then when McCain (my first election at 19 years old) and Romney lost. Now I know who they really are.,11S0SNEF1s,1
Not sure if it matters. You're either in a state where you're able to fight or you're not at this point.,11S0SNEF1s,3

"I know the vote doesnt matter, but we have no choice. But eh letting the dems go absolutely apeshit will force society to react (secede and/or civil war) faster maybe?",11S0SNEF1s,7
The Founding Fathers faced the same choice. It was the most difficult decision they ever had to make. They sacrificed a life of soft comforts for the right to fight for Liberty and Freedom. We face the same choice today.,11S0SNEF1s,4
"I’m still going to vote, just not for Republicans.",11S0SNEF1s,0
What exactly did Cruz say?,11S0SNEF1s,6
He basically denigrated the capitol protestors and used loose language suggesting Trump could have handled it differently. He didn't totally cuck but he wasn't as firm as he should have been.,11S0SNEF1s,8
He came out and said something about reprehensible bla bla bla riots at the capitol. Please tell me where the riot was.,11S0SNEF1s,4

And don’t think because you didn’t go to school for political science or have a college degree you’re unqualified to run for a seat in government. This country would be better off if more of the average Joe (not the sleepy one) were in government.,11S0SNEF1s,10

Can you set-up on a few different platforms? TDW may or may not be available in the future.,11S0SNEF1s,1
So much this. The point of all the BS going on in the last week is to weaken the political capital with which President Trump leaves office and lessen his ability to complete the job of reshaping the GOP to MAGA. Just like GOP establishment had to crush the tea party rebellion.,11S0SNEF1s,7

He didn’t have to sacrifice what should be his retirement years, but he did because he felt it was the right thing to do. He put it all on the line for America.",11S0SNEF1s,18

Lincoln destroyed America. He's the reason why the federal government is so powerful today,11S0SNEF1s,1
Revisionism is when all the high institutions tells you otherwise. Why are you still lurking here faggot?,11S0SNEF1s,1
Lincoln was a tyrant. The only US President to ever declare war on the US. He brutally slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Americans. Every other country that had slavery was able to abolish it without war. Brazil had 4x more slaves than the US during the same time period. They didn’t need a war to end it.,11S0SNEF1s,1
"Sure, but how many times has Brazil had a socialist government?",11S0SNEF1s,1
"I’ll support him no matter what. There is nothing the establishment could say or do to change my mind, and they will definitely try. They want “unity” but what they really mean is unity of thought.

They know this, and that is why these sick people will do everything they can to purge him, his ideas, and his accomplishments from history.",11S0SNEF1s,24
The MAGA hat will go down in history as the modern day confederate flag and will trigger white liberals for generations to come.,11S0SNEF1s,22

"Nah. You're right, they're all good with it as long as it is happening to someone else. But when it knocks on their own door, they start crying like the little girls they are.

Its seems that all world governments are becoming authoritarian dictatorships. The country where I live just suspended all civil liberties by fiat. If we are going to have a dictatorship the only world leader I trust to be in charge is Donald Trump.,11S0SNEF1s,18
Art of the deal is being played out before us,11S0SNEF1s,17
Did you hear him today? I don't think I've ever heard him seem so flat. His quiver is empty unless he goes very extreme. He will end up fighting hard for us after this but it's going to be different and difficult.,11S0SNEF1s,9
I pray you are right,11S0SNEF1s,2
"Or it's not being played at all because Trump is a huge pussy.
Which is a real shame.",11S0SNEF1s,-5

Yup! Its amazing how fragile it is though. Our fellows will willingly trade greatness for comfort. And freedom for a dole.,11S0SNEF1s,12
The saddest thing from today was Trump wasn't wearing his famous 🇺🇸 lapel pin when he did that speech. It just made me feel horrible when I noticed. It was like it was a way of saying something...,11S0SNEF1s,12
Wow! Secession is looking more and more likely,11S0SNEF1s,3
"Great name! And unfortunately yes. But wtf happened in the first place? I mean if we secede, we all know which country will be peaceful and prosperous, but we have to know how this happened so that if there is a secession, this doesn't happen all over again.",11S0SNEF1s,2
We didn’t listen to McCarthy. We need to control our money.,11S0SNEF1s,2

And though I havent done anything that is life changing in the sense of being able to retire all of a sudden, I have done well and have improved my financial situation somewhat which is better than nothing. I've never had a lot of money saved but I tired of the idea of the banks making high percentages of my money sitting in one of their accounts while they throw me scraps in interest.",11S0SNEF1s,3

He would have been screwed six ways to sunday if he won again. At this point I could believe that they would crash the economy and kill half the populace if that meant getting rid of him. Be worried pede. The market is in la la land.,11S0SNEF1s,2
"I just don't understand it. POTUS said for many, many times long before the election that massive fraud would be undertaken.... dude, you are the POTUS. You literally have numerous tools including many top tier assets that can go undercover and also investigate the fraud. You also could have had federal law enforcement at the ready in the highly suspect counting areas (read: Atlanta) ready to stop and seize people and equipment the second they started the midnight steal bullshit. And knew this was going to happen from the midterms election steal. I just cannot wrap my head around or fathom this. The future of this country would have been secured with a second term and voting reform. Now we are released into a den full of rabid monsters.",11S0SNEF1s,10
Have you read the constitution? Trump has followed it at every turn. The federal government as little control over elections in states.,11S0SNEF1s,3
The Federal Government doesn’t oversee state elections the only hope was DOJ and SCOTUS and both failed us.,11S0SNEF1s,1
"Donald Trump could have fucked off to wherever he wanted with his riches, instead he chose to take on the most stressful job in the world, put his entire life and his family’s under a microscope, and withstand constant attacks from Democrats and the media. He didn’t have to do any of this, but he did it for his country. Donald Trump truly loves America, he has said so for over 40 years. I’m forever thankful for his sacrifice and I’m blessed to be able to have experienced it. Idk what is next for him, or for this country. This country has been broken by the Democrats and the Establishment, idk if it can ever be repaired without drastic measure.",11S0SNEF1s,10

Yeah to be critical of trump (which we all have a right to at times) - but coming out with a net negative is delusional. Every scumbag official gets away with murder.

"The one thing liberals have is control of the narrative and never speaking ill of those on the left unless they have to for an election. Leftist politicians will defend even their most violent constituency and even kneel before them. When women invaded the Kavanaugh hearings, that wasn’t domestic terrorism. But when our side does same, the GOP rushes to disavow. Thats the difference and why anything the average conservative does is met with the full weight of the law. You stick your neck out. You get your head chopped off. No one will rally to your name, and the GOP will applaud your demise.",11RhOrv3Yf,31

We won because they bought their own bullshit last time in 2016 and real votes got through. Now, they’ve shored all that up, or are making progress towards that end. There is no path to victory for us in the future if we continue on as we do now. I do not condone public acts of violence, but one thing BLM and Antifa did do for the left is give them more power by sharing the monopoly on violence that the government is supposed to possess. They do that in other ways too, like you being fired if you speak up, etc. If we had our own popular media, there were antiestablishment violence groups to match or maybe dwarf BLM and Antifa, you could be fired for supporting leftist nonsense or the establishment, and strong networks of anti establishment social ties, then flat out blew up or shut down polling places if they didn’t allow observers and used digital voting machines, we’d have a chance. The establishment made it clear they can’t be negotiated with. There is no talking things out with them. I’ll say this again to be clear: I’m not advocating for violence. I do see there being no viable path forward without some extra legal groups that have the power to enact it though. I don’t think violence should be directed at small businesses or anything like BLM is doing. I can see people going after social media and media companies though. Wall Street. Pelosi types. There will also be less law-following when the laws are retarded, which the coming ones will be. Like mask mandates. Simply don’t follow those laws.

"True. Since we are again in the time of brother against brother a place to start is. Go from there. Keep things local at first. Lot easier to pull several (hundred to thousands) communities or groups together than trying to command and control 80+ million individually. President Trump attempted to do that from Twitter and they shut him down. Cannot be put in that position again. This is how it was before mass media and social media.

Even if Trump jails all these fuckers, it will backfire as sure as it did for Nineveh and Israel (every time they switched religion) Western society is predicated on Christianity. A very smart man (a guy that founded your therapist) said that we cannot keep society as it is once we move to atheism. All the old lessons, etc Even as a heathen, think logistically: when everyone is of a similar creed taught since birth, we can anticipate how things operate, etc. There are workarounds, as some atheists propose, but that requires public school indoctrination at minimum.",11RhOrv3Yf,4
You can do both. Pretty sure God would not want us to turn of the TV and sell that boat bought with banker loans and start living the way he wanted. That will amount to effective civil disobedience in minecraft.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"Yes. God allows one to play minecraft. I don't disagree about both. Just that some people use that lame excuse to be lazy, as you know. Society is weak. It is vulnerable to new ideologies because there is not a common value set and all the old ones are dismissed aggressively. It's a slippery slope. Started by dropping religious artifacts, then the value system keeps slipping. Now being patriotic is bad. Normies need to be told what to do and what not to do - along some general lines. Without it, they are ripe for commies to harvest. Look at the young women gravitating to Bernie - he became the voice of a very adamant and confident father - and people are missing that. In communism, allegiance to state becomes god. That's the only way it can work even for a little, because people have to be willing to sacrifice for the sake of an ideal. That's why commies hate religion. Communism requires motivation based on idealism. Capitalism let's two forms of human nature compete: laziness vs greed. Add in virtue and you get more success - thus, religion is really the friend of capitalism. Ironically, capitalism turns evil without moral duty.",11RhOrv3Yf,3
"You can, but wayyy there’s too much trust the plan here and it allows people to be complacent. Also what do you mean? Wouldnt god want us to live humbly? Without loans and tv?",11RhOrv3Yf,2
"yes, God would want us to live without all these fake consoomer garbage. If we had been doing that the state would have alot less power.",11RhOrv3Yf,5
"my take, I think God would want most people to live humbly but not all. Solomon had hundreds of concubines and God seemed good with that. Some people need to be kings or materials for whatever reason. He would not want us rotting away doing nothing or watching TV or waiting for the messiah to arrive. As simply as any one has put it, to basically take what you have and to do the most with it that you can. Speaking of Carl Jung, I think he had a word for what guided you on this process of what was the best thing you could do.

Stop spreading this lie. Insurrection Act and Martial Law are both legal avenues still on the table that Trump has NOT used. Trump just gave up when he still has options left. Lincoln did more than Trump to preserve the union.,11RhOrv3Yf,8
"I don't think Trump wants to go that far because if he does and it fails, the Republic is assured to be destroyed under military dictatorship when the trillionaires buy them all out. As of now, we still have a small chance, but still a chance. Also, Lincoln didn't have China breathing over the entire country. Globalism wasn't feasible with the tech at the time. Propaganda techniques weren't perfected yet. Central banking didn't own every bit of money in the entire world to the degree it does now. Even Mike fucking Pence betrayed him. There aren't enough patriots left at the highest levels of society. If Trump went full Insurrection Act, he'd just get betrayed even more and lose more severely. Now, the strategy is to build from the bottom up after weakening the heart of the beast.",11RhOrv3Yf,4
I agree...They would have immediately gone for the 25th and it would have been invoked. Then the military would've been used against him and us. It may have pushed us into the battle we need though but most don't want. Either way it would have been very ugly and I dont think he wanted that either,11RhOrv3Yf,1

I don't think he envisioned a breach. I think he envisioned a peaceful protest at the Capitol. They happen all the time.,11RhOrv3Yf,-1
"Thats fair I guess, but it was a peaceful protest. Our side committed no violence....so what they hell was he talking about when he called it heinous and said those people should be punished? What was heinous, was that woman being shot for climbing through a broken window.",11RhOrv3Yf,5

It remains to be seen if thats true or not.

More events like the Capital protest need to keep occurring if you ever want a legitimate government,11RhOrv3Yf,14
"I think what needs to happen is more information regarding voter fraud in ways that more people can understand. Because still a large portion of the country does not believe that our entire voting and judicial systems are corrupt. However, if we can show it in a way that they understand, they will actually be on our side and I think we would actually have the critical mass to fight it. Or we need the “Kraken” or proof that is so undeniable they cannot ignore it. Unfortunately that never actually appeared before 1/6.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
"They don't want to believe the voting and judicial system are corrupt. There is no evidence that will convince them to give up this fantasy, because if they open their eyes, they will have to face the reality that a lot more than voter fraud is going on. They would have to face the thought that maybe their favorite Hollywood star or favorite politician really is involved with the rape and murder of young children. They would have to face the thought that maybe 9/11 wasn't just a bunch of terrorists flying planes into a building. That maybe Oswald was the scape goat. That maybe some form of illuminati does exist. Or that there is a Creator whom they are accountable to.",11RhOrv3Yf,6

"Yes, they are... But Trump knew this from day one. The rumors that he's in Texas are likely very true. Immediately after the speech in DC, that plane (It's like AF1 but it's more of a command center) made one trip from DC all the way to the base in Texas. If they had him and were coercing him, he would pretty much be calling Biden God. He's not evening mentioning the loser's name. Stay positive.",11RhOrv3Yf,205

"I was thinking this too but to play devil's advocate. Is it not in the realm of possibility they got to him right away, put him at gun point, and then held him at gunpoint on the flight to Texas?",11RhOrv3Yf,3
"Anything is possible, of course. But without even the flimsiest evidence, there is no reason to believe a ""kidnap the president"" theory. Besides, if the left had actually killed or kidnapped DJT, does anyone here really believe they could keep quiet about it? They'd be gloating in every media organ in the country.

"The guy did his best and fought like hell but at the end of the day he was just in over his head like the rest of us. Fate is larger than all of us. I'm disappointed too in how things have gone down but it's important we keep fighting for Trump anyway, don't just let him be thrown to the dogs. It's the right thing to do, number one, and number two, if he goes down it crushes the entire movement. When it comes to manipulating the psychology of the masses, shows of force are important. We are being denounced loudly because they fear us, the deep state needs to reestablish their dominance before the normies begin to take us more seriously. That's what this media campaign is all about. The destruction of Trump will be a symbolic act of huge psychological significance, if it goes through our entire movement will be delegitimized. We need new leaders to step up now, yes, but Trump cannot just be prosecuted and thrown in prison like a dog.",11RhOrv3Yf,40
"Yours, and the comment prior, are two I completely agree with. Trump pulled back the curtain. It's up to the people, now. That also includes me. He's only one person. If we want change, we have to make it. We can't, nor should we, constantly rely on someone/something else to do all of the heavy lifting.",11RhOrv3Yf,9
Preparing for this but I think it is foolish to believe that with Trump gone or even betraying us we will not go away.this movement of america first is deep in the american spirit and tied to Christian faith.Trump was never GEOTUS that was a LARP.the lord uses the good ones and the bad ones use the lord.he served us but he role may expire we should respect and appreciate him for showing us prosperity and peace while pulling back the curtain on our enemies the rest is up to us,11RhOrv3Yf,6
"What Pompeo said a few days ago is ""there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump term"". Yesterday Trump said something similar, a ""smooth, seamless transition"".

"yes. yes i do think he would do that. being president was always on his bucket list. he did that. he had his fun fucking with them, he showed what he can do with the economy and proved all of that. he trolled people and fucked around with things. he had his fun. he's bored now. ""been there done that"". lol. he only cares about himself. he's done dude. he's not for us. these 12 days are going to be nothing but the stages of grief by us all",11RhOrv3Yf,-16
You're nuts. He's letting the transition go through but not conceding anything. I don't know what could not be more clear?,11RhOrv3Yf,8
"I think a lot of people are missing this simple logical truth, because this scenario has never happened before. (no need to call them nuts) There may be an idea going around with some people that the outgoing president technically has to concede, like it's some official step that leads to the next president. And if he doesn't that means ""IT'S HAPPENING GUYS!"" That is not true. Of course this hasn't happened before because the election has never been so blatantly stolen, with someone like Trump willing to fight for us until the bitter end. Obviously he'll never ""concede"" to a thief, but when time's up he's gotta exit the field whether the game is rigged or not. He'll do the minimum required. He doesn't want to make it easy for the Chinese puppet, but not allowing the transition to go through as proscribed may cause headaches for his staff and more problems that will just be blamed on him.",11RhOrv3Yf,8

How is this weird? How long are y'all going to keep reading into shit that isn't there?,11RhOrv3Yf,56
"See there are dangers in reading too much into things where you become crazy.
At face value this tweet says ""hey guys your voices will be heard keep fighting don't let them disrespect you"" The deeper meaning could mean ""don't worry you will be heard i haven't dropped the moab, hold the line"". Honestly half of Trump's words can always be spun in numerous ways and have millions of meanings. This is why I don't bother with it and just read things at face value and look for action. Too many yoyo heartbreaks if you don't. When Trump pulls some strings and there is concrete change in this situation, then it's a bonus. Until then all this larping ends up fucking with you mentally. You will become a bernie bro or Hillary fan base and that's unacceptable. Pedes don't worry our time will come eventually",11RhOrv3Yf,54
"This is the way I read Trump's tweets too. They often can be interpreted in many ways - face value and potential deeper meanings. I don't like to play the ""what does he REALLY mean"" game. It's better to just wait and see how it plays out.",11RhOrv3Yf,28
"Yes. Which is where, for the first time, I honestly felt his detractors were right. He was exceedingly careless in using that language. Is he really that out of touch with what his movement has come to mean and represent? In what images that conjures up in our minds? Same for what transpired on the 6th. His message about Pence not having the courage to do what was right to save our country felt an awful lot like he was saying, ""Fuck it, burn it down!"" Especially when juxtaposed against his call to march to that capitol, that he was going there with them. It's like, wow! With all of the Rubicon Don talk going on everywhere, that was either insanely out of touch or intentionally combustive. Neither of which is a good look, IMO.",11RhOrv3Yf,9
"It was a great look. Own the victory. For a brief moment in time, we made these Congress critters cower and fear for their lives. The government should fear WE THE PEOPLE, not the other way around!",11RhOrv3Yf,6
"""His movement"" is a populist coalition representing many different ideological subgroups who believe in America First. There's plenty of diversity of opinion on this site alone, and we don't even represent the whole movement. His own team dismissed the Rubicon Don nonsense. That's why I laugh when someone yells ""85,000,000 OF US ARE READY TO STAND UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY! GEOTUS JUST SAY THE WORD!"" lol no",11RhOrv3Yf,-1
"That's why I laugh when someone yells ""85,000,000 OF US ARE READY TO STAND UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY! GEOTUS JUST SAY THE WORD!"" lol no That was my response as well. Like, ""What? Do you people even hear yourselves?""",11RhOrv3Yf,2
Antifa rushed the capitol. It will be wild was them certifying the election and Pence backstabbing them.,11RhOrv3Yf,0
"It wasn't antifa it was our guys. I was there. Own the victory. We made them fear us, they are scared shitless, keep up the momentum",11RhOrv3Yf,6
Who cares what the media says? They're liars. We were absolutely justified occupying Congress after a stolen election.,11RhOrv3Yf,2
well it played out alright...and in the end? he didnt have our backs at all and he can fuck himself. im done with him. he's just like the rest of them. fuck em all,11RhOrv3Yf,2
"Trump is a figurehead of a movement that created him. He didn't create MAGA; he embodied it and gave it a name. MAGA was previously the Tea Party. There are plenty of Americans, left and right, that view this government as a compromised, abject failure. The key difference is how we make it better - right wants it basically removed, and left wants it to be all-encompassing (because they don't see how that always ends badly).",11RhOrv3Yf,3
"I agree with everything you said up until ""the left wants it to be all encompassing"". No. They want Trump and all of his supporters dead.",11RhOrv3Yf,3
"Sorry I meant they want absolute power for the government, which would include the power to cleanse the opposition (as it always goes in authoritarian regimes). It's quite obvious they want not just Trump supporters, but fence-sitters murdered.",11RhOrv3Yf,4
"Agreed. I had something close to a sense of peace, of closure, at the realization that it's over. The ""yoyo heartbreaks"" as you say are too much, emotionally, to keep chasing. The elation we felt November 2016 was an incredible high, conversely, this result was a crushing demoralizing blow - one that I'm still trying to process. But chasing these posts hinting at MOAB incoming...just larps fucking with us, I'm afraid.",11RhOrv3Yf,11
"That retard Q shit messed a lot of people up too, always trying to find shit that isn't there.

New political party coming.,11RhOrv3Yf,3
just makes it easier to cheat having 3 parties.,11RhOrv3Yf,13
"A massive amount of republican voters are pissed at the GOP right now. A new America First party could destroy them like how the slavery debate destroyed the Whigs. Which would be ironic, since that's how the GOP became a major party in the first place. Are all those Lion Party memes about to come true?",11RhOrv3Yf,9
what fucking difference does your party make when they rig the election and count your vote for the other guy? a 3rd party will only make dominion cheating easier. why the fuck do i need to keep explaining this to people?! god damn people are stupid. thats why this is all happening too i bet!,11RhOrv3Yf,17
Reality is that Trump's support will be only a fraction of he continues to denounce his own supporters and actions he passively encouraged.if this continues people will not follow Trump again.maga isn't going anywhere but if election integrity isn't meaningfully addressed Maga will not play the election game.i take my ball and go home.working locally to achieve change and prepare for what's down the pipe,11RhOrv3Yf,6
The deep state wasn't running things with massive national surveillance then. Ironically it was Lincoln who started the federal centralization that eventually let them come to power. That and we had fewer state laws embedding parties into the government.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
There in the front this is a fact.any crowd like that with a righteous cause and passions high act upon emotion especially when you look back at a million people and you hear alot of push.stevie wonder could see what would happen without any leadership or guidance in that situation.If Trump had been there to Temper emotions we would be having a different discussion,11RhOrv3Yf,2
"I have no idea why people are so quick to assign the greatest american event in my life time (outside of possibly the election of 2016) to AntiFa. ""We're sorry nazis, it wasn't us who stormed the beaches of normandy, it was those damn russians trying to make us look bad"".",11RhOrv3Yf,2

"Well I'll tell you what is not there, justice and a fair democracy so I'd say believing that somehow this all gets magically fixed in the next couple of days is seriously reading into something that is not there. We all saw this coming, then we watched it happen and now it's 1/8/21 and nothing has changed. So who is really reading into things? What I am reading is the writing on the wall, this is all over. I don't want Trump telling me I will personally be fine in the future, I am worried about my country right fucking now and I am not hearing anything like that anymore lately. So I'd argue that those who believe we have a fight on our hands and we can win it have been on the right side of history but have seriously been reading into something that just isn't there.",11RhOrv3Yf,5
"It's not. He's not crazy. He's making his pushes inch by inch. He still is goingn to listen to us, we just need to be receptive and accept (unfortunately) whatever happens for the next week.",11RhOrv3Yf,1

I guess it works for leftists and normies.,11RhOrv3Yf,15
I had that thought last night. It occurred to me that the boot likely won’t be on my throat in my lifetime. But my children? The boot will be on their throat a little harder. Their future children? Harder than that. Communism has infiltrated and destroyed freedom in countries in much less than two generations. Amassing wealth won’t save your loved ones from what’s coming. It only means you’ll have more to lose.,11RhOrv3Yf,13

"He needs to use the military. He needs to fight with every tool at his disposal. If Biden pulls off this steal, I cannot imagine how the nation would ever recover.",11RhOrv3Yf,3
So he's suddenly unbanned now?,11RhOrv3Yf,282
"Yeah, what’s up with that?",11RhOrv3Yf,119
"Yes, it was 12 hours as long as he deleted his tweets. I will not speculate as to whether or not he deleted them.",11RhOrv3Yf,82
"Here's one of them:

"I don't, other than the source seemed trustworthy and lack a motive to be otherwise",11RhOrv3Yf,1
Twitter already deleted the tweets so all he had to do was remove the posts that say this tweet is unavailable.,11RhOrv3Yf,21
"That’s a whole new level of censorship. “Remove your tweets we’ve already deleted to use normies’ services again, Bigot.”",11RhOrv3Yf,52
Technocracy the president is now dictated by the unelected social media Technocrats,11RhOrv3Yf,22
YES! I seriously asked that myself for the last couple of years. He could have easily gone to GAB or Parler and posted exclusivly. He literally could have gone to his billionaire buddies and gotten them to fund a new one if he wanted. This really pissed me off about him.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"It's beyond censorship - It's pavlovian training you to do what they want. Do what we don't want (create dissenting speech)? Punishment.
Do what we want (delete your dissenting speech)? Reward.",11RhOrv3Yf,6
New? Twitter has been doing this for years,11RhOrv3Yf,5
"he didn’t delete them, the ban expired regardless at 12 hours past",11RhOrv3Yf,1
ANY ban is not okay. Don't defend twitter.,11RhOrv3Yf,18
"What the fuck is this comment? He's not defending Twitter, he's explaining why Trump is unbanned to people who were aware.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
"It was only a 24 hour suspension on Twitter, not an outright ban",11RhOrv3Yf,21
"""only"". still not cool.",11RhOrv3Yf,15
"Not cool? They censored the leader of a protest during the most influential day since 9/11. It's the most fucked up thing that any company has legally done to this country since the Industrial Revolution. Trump, we need to hear your messages. I cannot, in good faith, take orders from a leader who sends them on a compromised platform. 2024 will not happen without moving somewhere else first.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
Why were there news reports saying he was banned until the 20th?,11RhOrv3Yf,3
"I think FB was the only permanent ban. The media lied and said he was permanently banned on EVERY platform which as usual isn't true, his Youtube is still there and he put that video up last night",11RhOrv3Yf,14
I believe he deleted the tweets they banned him for,11RhOrv3Yf,14
Twitter already deleted those tweets for him,11RhOrv3Yf,6
Yea this stinks to high heaven... Nothing has made sense the last two days.,11RhOrv3Yf,96
the last 2 days feel like a weird dream,11RhOrv3Yf,44
"What's also very odd, as another pede pointed out, GIANT VOICE is the emergency communications system that is used on military bases. (www.frontlinewarningsystems.com) I'm not natively an English speaker but the phrase 'GIANT VOICE', capitalized for emphasis, sounds somewhat odd in the sentence. It's almost forced? Like you don't instictively grab for the words 'giant voice', you'd rather say 'your voice will be heard'.",11RhOrv3Yf,16
Interesting find. You should post the direct page in another post and get some discussion going. http://www.frontlinewarningsystems.com/pages/military-giant-voice-systems,11RhOrv3Yf,2
"I should. Another pede also noticed and I didn't want to take it away from him, he made a thread separately so I felt like it'd be a duplicate. Maybe I'm nuts and lost the plot. I'm no Q larper, never have been. But if GIANT VOICE is a military system, it's almost like he's saying ""You've been thrashed about, lied about, even killed. From now on no-one will hurt any more of my patriots, or treat them unfairly because I am unleashing the military"". Because otherwise how is the tweet true? With Biden we WILL be treated unfairly just by having a tyrannical usurper election.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
"Well Mr. joined 16 hours ago, I'd say it feels weird because it sounds like its just trying to make all the patriots complacent and weak so they'll just get on the train in a couple months. It doesn't sound like Trump. It sounds like someone impersonating Trump.",11RhOrv3Yf,17
"You're a newbie here, but I think you're one of the genuine ones that's appeared. Everything about the last 2 days has felt fake.",11RhOrv3Yf,8
"You're just disappointed the hype dropped off a cliff and left you standing empty handed. As am I. The reason you're feeling something isn't right is because you're hearing Trump concede, something no one is used to hearing from him. Same with McEnany.",11RhOrv3Yf,5
"I personally feel I've seen all that and he fulfilled those promises. But the courts and the politicians wouldn't play ball, so he walked away with his hands tied. No?",11RhOrv3Yf,1
"Maybe, I feel it's all very odd BUT GIANT VOICE is the emergency communications system that is used on military bases. (www.frontlinewarningsystems.com) The phrase 'giant voice' sounds somewhat odd in the sentence, and it's capitalized too. I am trying to convince myself that it's over, but he's giving me a shot of hopium....",11RhOrv3Yf,3
"If Trump knows what Giant Voice is within the context of the military warning system, then this tweet is likely him signaling military allies for help. http://frontlinewarningsystems.com/pages/military-giant-voice-systems",11RhOrv3Yf,2
THE TWEET YOU DIDN'T GET TO SEE: https://kekpe.pe/i/5ff8732add8a6.jpeg,11RhOrv3Yf,1
Bro I think Q is BS but that video Trump released last night looked doctored somehow. Who did it and for what purpose I don't know but I don't trust it.,11RhOrv3Yf,13
That's because we've been watching and listening to Trump for the past 4 years. We know what he's like and everything about these tweets and videos reeks of someone who is trying to impersonate Trump.,11RhOrv3Yf,12
Yeah that video looked fake. Mouth movements were so weird.,11RhOrv3Yf,8
The neck movements looked weird to me. Unless that is just the green screen?,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"Ah yes, the delusional. Trump looks far younger vs the video of him during the protest.
His neck clips several times in the video.
The higher resolution of the flags vs everything else leans towards a fake background.
Same face frame used twice in the same clip.
Uploaded by Twitter and not Trump's account. No doubt you are one of those ""believe in science"" people I read so much about.",11RhOrv3Yf,5
Ok but then why did he capitalize the words GIANT VOICE which is a military mass emergency notification/communication system? It seems like an odd choice of words.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
Na quit dooming for another 12 days please,11RhOrv3Yf,2
"The video being called a fake has nothing to so with “q”, 2nd terms or anything else. Go watch the “concession” video, stare at his face. Over exaggerated expressions, I could tell immediately it was fake. Voice sounds real, but the video is... wrong. Others have taken it further with frame by frame analysis, but you don’t have to. Just watch it and trust your gut. It’s creepy. Deep fakes have become amazing, but it’s still detectable by the human subconscious similar to how many will have a sense about dangerous people. For whatever reason (whether good or very bad) in my opinion, it’s not real.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
"He's saying it is NOT OVER, guys... There is no concession.",11RhOrv3Yf,20
"Maybe this rumor mill isn't big enough, but there's quite a few people convinced his last two videos are deepfakes",11RhOrv3Yf,11
"It is over at least for 4 years, stop being delusional",11RhOrv3Yf,0
I agree. Pres trump plans on being in office his next term.,11RhOrv3Yf,0
He was probably threatened with litigation once he's out of office,11RhOrv3Yf,3
"Just imagine that it's all over. Now does it makes sense? It does. How long have we been hearing that there is a fight happening? What results, any result, have you seen from that? It's clear there was fraud, it should have been a slam dunk, nothing has happened and now we are hearing ""don't worry, you guys will be fine in the future."" Again, imagine it's all over and this all starts to make sense.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
the twitter ban was the only one that had a 12 hour shelf life. they never said they would ban him outright,11RhOrv3Yf,28
They said he wouldn't be able to post until he removes the 3 banned tweets. He did not remove them.,11RhOrv3Yf,19
The tweets were already removed by Twitter. moot point.,11RhOrv3Yf,7
"So why would they go back on their word? I'll tell ya why, because they were forced to. It's the only reason.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
Their stock prices were dropping too. That's pretty good incentive.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
"Twitter stock has not been dropping. Far from it. I've been shorting it with the theory trump would leave or get banned and trump supporters would boycott. Hasn't worked out, their stock is up huge",11RhOrv3Yf,-2
Idk what kind of trading you're doing but it's definitely down lol,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"??????????? I started shorting it 4 or 5 weeks ago. It went up 25+%. Trading happened before this week, lol. Zoom out. From 47ish straight to $54 and change not long ago. Fun times.....glad I have 0 puts hahaha. Oh well.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
I believe he had a 12 hour Twitter suspension. Facebook/Instagram banned him.,11RhOrv3Yf,16
It was 12 hours in Twitter. Facebook cunt is the one that permabanned him. I expect Twitter to do the same very soon.,11RhOrv3Yf,13
"Same, they’ll permanently memory hole him by the 20th.",11RhOrv3Yf,5
still did it. not like you can know what is really going on,11RhOrv3Yf,1
Supreme Court is about to be flooded and packed with 100 RBG style far left politicians to strip our 2nd Amendment away.,11RhOrv3Yf,71
1st and 2nd Amendment will be gone or completely neutered by Joepedo and Cumallah's packed Supreme court.,11RhOrv3Yf,23
And rest assured they will also be coming for your religion and freedom of speech. The only people who will have 1A rights will be those that the courts fear will burn down their houses.,11RhOrv3Yf,10
They don't even need to. They have seven of the nine justices when it really counts.,11RhOrv3Yf,9
They may not need to but I don't see them taking any chances ever again.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
Is it freeing to not have to care about the Supreme Court anymore?,11RhOrv3Yf,4
Can't wait for that first Soros picked tranny judge.,11RhOrv3Yf,7

Embrace it. Give up on the courts. Openly disrespect them. Create your own kinds of courts for settling disputes. Take back as much authority from them as you can.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
These are exactly the kinds of strategies that we should be talking about here. As leftist flee their shithole cities they must be made to feel unwelcome if they try to bring their BS with them.

Latter parts of this claim are disputed by anyone who's interacted with liberals,11RhOrv3Yf,177
Twitter should fact check this w miss Lindsay promising jail time to protestors,11RhOrv3Yf,9
The point is for you millions of patriots to stick together no matter what. Try and physically interact with each other every month. Support anyone that the Left-wing Hyenas attempt to pick off. That's a peaceful and totally winning strategy.,11RhOrv3Yf,5
"Yeah we were hoping that vid was fake, it was our last string of hope",11RhOrv3Yf,38
A typed tweet is even easier to fake though!,11RhOrv3Yf,55
a fake trump tweet would congratulate biden,11RhOrv3Yf,6
"I mean let’s be honest, it has to at least seem a little real to work.",11RhOrv3Yf,12
"Possibly, although it appears they're using shills to try to prop up a concession narrative.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
Anyone can make a tweet. I want a video that hasn't been confirmed as a deep fake.,11RhOrv3Yf,23
Are you sure about that? I'm not sure Joe Biden could make a tweet even if he died and went to tweet heaven lol.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
Confirmed how? As in the technology exists? Just look at the Luke Skywalker returning in the Mandalorian. The technology to do deep fakes is being paraded right in front of our faces.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"You take a video, it analyzes it and gives you a percentage that the video is fake. With real videos the percentage is low. With fake videos the percentage is high. The video tweet had >90% and fails the uncanny valley test to most viewers. It is deep learning technology if you are interested.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
Please show me where an generative adversarial network decoder actually showed a .9 fake probability. There are open source ones all over. But I never saw a score showing it was fake,11RhOrv3Yf,2
"I am sorry, I had to reread your original post, because I think I read it too quickly. I think I left off the ""n't"" of your hasn't and that you were saying you wanted to see a confirmed deep fake video. As in, that you didn't they existed at all. My fault completely. Sorry. I should probably eat breakfast before hopping on here first thing in the morning.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
Did you think Luke looked genuinely real?,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"I haven't watched Star Wars since Disney killed it years ago. Doesn't mean I hadn't heard of this happening. My point is this. The Luke Skywalker thing is what they're doing in the entertainment industry and at a glance, he certainly looks real enough to suspend ones disbelief for the show. If this is what is being used in he public, one can argue that they have even more advanced stuff for their political machinations. Having a man stand behind a podium and just speak is certainly easier than an action scene as well. They don't need you to believe that this deepfake is Trump for a long time, just for the next 2 weeks and people are buying it.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
The presidents video was also like 720p at best..24fps,11RhOrv3Yf,3
"You're right, but the video itself is evidence. Haven't you seen the numerous oddities in his 'concession' speech? It all resembles that of a deepfake.",11RhOrv3Yf,14
"It definitely does. All the people on here repeating ""He's conceded! Just accept it! Cope!"" or some variation thereof just make it even more obvious that something weird is going on.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
"Uploaded it to a scanner, absolutely no indication that it's fake. Also imagine what it means if it were real: Trump and his entire family are dead, and the people behind the deep fake are going to somehow keep this hidden from everyone forever. Nobody will question why Ivanka disappeared off the face of the Earth. How the fuck is this a sane thing to believe you retarded fucking hopium addicts?",11RhOrv3Yf,0
"Okay, first off, how about we keep it civil, rather than calling me a ‘retarded hopium addict.’ Secondly, a scanner is in no way a reliable indicator of deepfake (oh, and I should mention other scanners that’ve been used have flagged the video suspicious, contrary to your result); especially when using your own eyes proves contrary to the scanner. Thirdly, if it were real (which I’m very sure it is), it doesn’t mean Trump and his family are all dead. That is called an assumption. There are plenty of other logical theories if that is the case other than “Trump and his entire family are dead.”",11RhOrv3Yf,2

His message for 5 years has been spot on but he has to know by now that the deep state is more than even he can tackle.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
It doesn’t mean the establishment will stop treating us unfairly it means we will no longer stand for them to treat us unfairly.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"I'm frankly starting to think God does not will it. Look at us. Just look at us and tell me God is still with us lighting our way. What can you and I point to in the last decade (or several) and say ""see we are a good people who follow God""? We have people adopting kids to raise them as the opposite sex for hell's sake. We have little boys twerking for grown men who suffer no consequences for their actions. I think God has done what he has said he will do, turn his back when we have chosen the path of wickedness and there is no doubt that we have in general chosen that path firmly in our society. If he let the Jews suffer for their sins then why not us too. What is there about us today that makes us think we do not deserve bondage and suffering? If you have hope then I'm happy for you but I see no reason for hope personally. I think that sadly we are reaping what we have sown.",11RhOrv3Yf,4
Great points and encouraging. I guess I should just say that I think we're about to suffer mightily for a while. We may be spared utter destruction but our Republic is certainly done for.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
"There is still hope... but if Biden and Harris do take power, then America is basically through. He’s saying that maybe God isn’t willing a second Trump term. People get the governments they deserve. It was maybe a long shot to hope that America could get a real president again.",11RhOrv3Yf,3
"The video is still likely a fake, as is this tweet. ""The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me""? That's not right. Trump won by a lot and he knows it.",11RhOrv3Yf,13
He’s said 80 million before I think.,11RhOrv3Yf,8
He's remained courageous and honest in the face of censorship before. This doesn't seem like him.,11RhOrv3Yf,2
I’d say stealing an election from someone is a form of disrespect and unfair treatment...,11RhOrv3Yf,159
Will you let them treat you unfair? Or will you take a stand with 75 million other patriots and make your voice be heard?,11RhOrv3Yf,19
"This is what pisses me off. ""Will be wild""? Really?",11RhOrv3Yf,12
"If by wild he meant ""the shabby demise of MAGA, imploding forever and discredited by history"", sure.",11RhOrv3Yf,4
Uhh I think hundreds of thousands of Patriots swarming DC and steamrolling their way right into Pelosi's office is a decisive victory. They are scared shitless. Keep up the momentum,11RhOrv3Yf,4
It makes me think it didn’t go as he had planned and I wonder how he was hoping it’d be,11RhOrv3Yf,4
I am pretty sure he expected Pence to not to be a traitor. He wanted people to be there for the historic event of Pence throwing out the electoral votes. He was too trusting.,11RhOrv3Yf,7
Maybe hoping we caught them in tunnels and had them swinging in the chambers from the balconies?,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"I guess we should wait for Trump to step down so he doesn't tell us to ""go home"" again.",11RhOrv3Yf,11
Yeah because when we raise our voices people listen and change happens./s We all know voices are not effective. It's why the left loot and riot. They call it voices but they know damned well only violence has swayed any of our politicians. Period. Peaceful protest has never accomplished a single thing in the history of our planet.,11RhOrv3Yf,6
There is no such thing as peace. In nature there is no peace only chaos Strength is the only thing that matters,11RhOrv3Yf,2
"And this right here is not understood and in fact entirely ignored. I mean we are currently living in the most peaceful stable era in history in the most peaceful stable country in the history of the world and 50% of us go out and protest it because it's not fair and hurts our feelings and makes transgenders feel like their weirdos, etc. etc.. I want these people to be forced into remote areas and forced to survive and surely they will all die, or more likely, be enslaved by someone within the first week. Of course they'd be set free the very next week when it gets discovered they are useless and can't work lol.",11RhOrv3Yf,3
"And statements like, ""we don't just want to defeat you, we want to eliminate you entirely,"" is a sure sign of more than just disrespect to come.",11RhOrv3Yf,4
precisely. it aint happening bub,11RhOrv3Yf,2
Exactly. I’ve already renounced my GOP membership and plan to never go back.,11RhOrv3Yf,131
I will never again vote in a US election. Secession is the only path now. The rot is too deep.,11RhOrv3Yf,9
Why will people vote if they know there is rigging?,11RhOrv3Yf,122
They rigged this election. Who is stopping us from doing the same next time? Our own pride and morals. Time to take the gloves off. This is no longer a fair fight.,11RhOrv3Yf,47
"Exactly. They sort of got away with it for now because they had the courts, billionaires, Globalists, elites, and big tech on their side. We'd die before we even tried.",11RhOrv3Yf,5
Hahaha. Good luck getting hired as an election worker.,11RhOrv3Yf,3
You really don't know how cities and my icipal govt works do you?,11RhOrv3Yf,0
"Right except that they will just ""send you home"" and keep counting while you are not there.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
"The deep state, corrupt cities, Congress, and courts are keeping us from doing it next time or ever.",11RhOrv3Yf,13
I bet they will negotiate a false electoral reform to pacify the masses and continue to cheat. The point is that even with legal votes Biden will import as many foreign votes as necessary.,11RhOrv3Yf,5
Biden isn't going to do shit. He can't even spell his own fucking name and I'll be surprised if he isn't out in 6 months anyway. But your points still stands if you put the name Harris in there. I honestly think that after 4 years this entire country will all agree on thing unanimously; that we don't ever want a black woman in office every again and must avoid it at all costs. Can you imagine what a shit show this will be in 4 years because we had a Pres chosen simply for her gender and skin color?,11RhOrv3Yf,3
Then we will to,11RhOrv3Yf,1
The law is selectively enforced. You can bet they will enforce all of it against Republicans.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
True but do you still see any reason for you to be Republican at his point? Or any of us. I actually have hated them for a long time now and only and here because of Trump and not one thing more than that. The GOP can all hang too as far as I'm concerned.,11RhOrv3Yf,2
"No, the GOP is dead. I guess I should change that to say they will enforce laws only against patriots.",11RhOrv3Yf,3
Then we will break the laws so bad they are destroyed and need to be fixed. How fast will the Dems cry for voter ID after they see 1 million unregistered Patriots voting? We must beat them at their own game,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"State legislatures could maybe make elections a bit more secure (on state level). Not sure if it will happen, but some of them seemed to want to change things too",11RhOrv3Yf,2
"It reminds me of the ""Slugs for Salt"" meme every time someone talks about voting here.",11RhOrv3Yf,6
"Exactly! We have ignored local elections for too long. Put your effort THERE first. They have a bigger impact on your life and are a much stronger ally when the state or fed gov comes down on you. This is the way, smaller elections, get informed on those and target those in your community. Run if you are charismatic and informed.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
It's like Christmas and Santa Claus... It's a tradition!,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"Because we will volunteer as poll watchers, ballot counters, local elections. We will primary the rinos, support maga candidates. We will research and learn cyber security,, and learn to fight the information war the same way silicon valley does.. Continue to use EVERY avenue and NOT give up, no matter the odds.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
WE are the resistance now.,11RhOrv3Yf,109
Awoman to that,11RhOrv3Yf,16
We are the news now.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
Always have been,11RhOrv3Yf,1
Not gonna lie. I kinda feel like Obi Wan at the end of Episode III. The GOP is basically Vader at this point.,11RhOrv3Yf,3
How do you make your bold bigger than normal? Do you add 8 asterisks instead of 4? Lol,11RhOrv3Yf,3
Use 1 asterisk. The more you use the smaller the font.,11RhOrv3Yf,13

Add a # before it without any space,11RhOrv3Yf,2
We must take it back. Gloves are off. Time to beat them at their own game.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
How will we have a giant voice?,11RhOrv3Yf,75
The traitorous RINOS will pretend to represent us to get us back on the GOP plantation. But don't fall for it. The moment shit gets tough again they will stab us in the back.,11RhOrv3Yf,13
Literally just google “giant voice”,11RhOrv3Yf,11
oh shit oh fuck,11RhOrv3Yf,8
My sentiments exactly. War? Probably not... but... what if? Are the minecraft servers quick enough to handle it?,11RhOrv3Yf,4
"Big if true. If Trump still has influence over the army (he was their general for 4 years after all), there's no way Biden gets us wrapped up in a devastating and useless foreign war.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
Good to know!,11RhOrv3Yf,3
"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter! I will wear he label of ""terrorist"" proudly if it comes from them.",11RhOrv3Yf,3
Who cares? They'd be calling us terrorists anyway no matter what happened,11RhOrv3Yf,3
"democrats torched city hall, police stations, etc, and the media supported it",11RhOrv3Yf,1
You're a coward,11RhOrv3Yf,1
Well they called us Nazis for 4 years and that wasn’t true either.,11RhOrv3Yf,2
Our differences are irreparable. Secession is the only answer. Hope everyone bought enough ammo for the war.,11RhOrv3Yf,2
DO NOT CONCEDE DECLAS EVERYTHING THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND CORRUPT. IT DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE PRESERVED OR PROTECTED.,11RhOrv3Yf,75

Not trusting it until I can see him live,11RhOrv3Yf,63
WE'RE ALREADY BEING DISRESPECTED AND TREATED UNFAIRLY! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS PANDERING BULLSHIT?!,11RhOrv3Yf,56
fuck off and die faghot,11RhOrv3Yf,6
Ye of little faith,11RhOrv3Yf,1
This is not a deep fake tweet. Thats my president!,11RhOrv3Yf,52
"And I just saw yesterday where he is calling for healing and reconciliation. Reconcile myself to what? We didn't do any of the bullshit and destruction. So now Trump has the same message as Pedo Joe, ""let's come together and heal"". Fucking bullshit!!!",11RhOrv3Yf,9
"Yeah, I hate hearing him use the same words that Joe uses to pacify us. But at the same time, we've all been so worked up over the past several months that we've barely had any time to live peacefully. That type of long-term stress will maim your mind and body, leaving you destitute by the time the real revolution occurs. So give him the benefit of the doubt. Don't let ""healing and reconciliation"" translate into ""lazy pacifism"" like it does with the Left. Stay peaceful but aware.",11RhOrv3Yf,2
"""You're the chosen one! You were supposed to destroy the Sith - not join them!""",11RhOrv3Yf,2
Or maybe even a much more sinister reason. He knows it's over and we are now the hunted and he doesn't want to see that happen. Bending the knee is the only thing the left understand and he knows this. I think he knows it ultimately won't matter but I do honestly believe he cares about us.,11RhOrv3Yf,3
"This tweet comes from ""Twitter by iPhone"" like his usual tweets. Last night's ""concession"" tweet was by ""Twitter Media Studio"".",11RhOrv3Yf,18
...this wasn't a video,11RhOrv3Yf,3

"Fuck outta here. Go to Syria, then asshole.",11RhOrv3Yf,-16
We’re already there. Did you not see the rampant fraud in the last election?,11RhOrv3Yf,11
Yes but you don't pretend to care about the Constitution one minute and then Pelosi-it-up the next.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"The Constitution is a contract. If one party breaks a contract, the others are released from their obligations.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
So you believe in nothing but the cult of personality. The founders were brilliant enough to create something that withstands people like you.,11RhOrv3Yf,0
If bombings are part and parcel of living in a big city...,11RhOrv3Yf,1

look at this dumb faggot!,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"Blacktankguy, what a weird comment.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
"Yeah, i didn't mean for it to seem so weird. When I read the tweet, my first reaction was ""this is obviously written by trump"". But in hindsight, I probably should have worded it differently.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
"How the fuck does anyone on here read this tweet and think ""hmmm, I think this is Trump giving up on us / confirming the 2024 run""?????",11RhOrv3Yf,43
They’re sending every doomer/shill they have at us. The demoralization effort is so fucking blatant that Hellen Keller can see it,11RhOrv3Yf,36
"I don't know man, I'm 100% behind Trump but I heard him last night talk about peaceful transition and coming together and healing. That is complete and utter bullshit and we all know it. How in your mind that means there's still hope is beyond me. What am I missing? How did he not clearly call it quits yesterday and ask us to do the same?",11RhOrv3Yf,4
Code. Think of the situation we're all in. He has to say that.,11RhOrv3Yf,0
Eh maybe? I guess in my mind he didn't have to say anything at all. I mean Biden has not condemned Antifa for example and that worked out just fine for him and everyone else. Why of necessity did Trump need to say anything yesterday? I think he had a choice and chose as he did for a reason - it's over because he no longer has the support of most judges and politicians who are slime and want to go back to how things were.,11RhOrv3Yf,2
Exactly. They have defeated Trump but the bigger concern has always been the movement. They have to have us all demoralized and unwilling to fight back. Don’t take the black pill. I did prior to 16. Trumps election showed me I should always keep hope and work bc God works in mysterious ways.,11RhOrv3Yf,3
"This site has changed over night. To think there haven't been ""users"" waiting for this moment as essentially a negative psyops effort to The core of Trump's support is crazy. No fault of the moderators either as these doomers in waiting are technically following all the rules... I wager most folks are just not posting much right now in the mass confusion of what comes next. I for one am STAYING FUCKING POSITIVE.",11RhOrv3Yf,4
"Isn't this site the top 300 in US now? There are wolves in sheep's clothing here, and they've been working double time to demoralize. I was on this site late last night, and you could tell the shills went to bed, because the old win spirit seemed restored.",11RhOrv3Yf,3
This site has changed over night. Gee I wonder if that has to do with Trump making a live concession speech last night or something.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"Exactly right, I think the Trump from yesterday ""wasn't the Trump we're looking for"" but a ""droid"", lol. In all seriousness, I think we're not done yet.",11RhOrv3Yf,-1
"Yeah, this totally fits in with everything he said yesterday in that ""video"". Am I the only one who feels like someone is playing hot and cold with us, and feeling totally confused?",11RhOrv3Yf,42
"Nope. Much like the election fraud, none of this makes fucking sense and is totally out of line with the behavior of Trump.",11RhOrv3Yf,33
You're not alone. Something's off about all of this.,11RhOrv3Yf,18
"It all starts to make sense the second you come to realize it's over. This is just sort of a ""but we'll still be friends"" type of comment. Empty of any real substance. That video of him yesterday was very clear to me and I'm a little surprised that it could have led to any confusion. That was clearly, ""we need to be peaceful and start the healing process and work together.""",11RhOrv3Yf,0
What do you think he means by this?,11RhOrv3Yf,37
Is it even him?,11RhOrv3Yf,24
"The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me Trump knows it's more than that. Something's not right here.",11RhOrv3Yf,32
He doesnt want twitter to flag and remove.Really bad .,11RhOrv3Yf,3
Probably. But who knows anymore.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
Yes. Conspiracies aren’t usually this retarded,11RhOrv3Yf,1
It sounds like all the Larping about the Insurrection and Martial Law is not going to be a LARP.,11RhOrv3Yf,20
How did you get that out of this tweet?,11RhOrv3Yf,29
"You can rearrange the letter of his Tweet to spell out ""Martial law"" which some left over letters.",11RhOrv3Yf,21
You'll also notice there are at least 3 letters in the tweet. Half life 3 confirmed. Still skeptical? There are also at least 3 words. I'll leave you to collect yourself now.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
"Yeah I've been one of the strongest proponents of both those options because he hasn't fully exhausted his legal options until he's used those, but even I don't see how this tweet implies anything related to those.",11RhOrv3Yf,11
More like the opposite? No big booms before going out Is he even going to declassify shit? Based on this tweet id say no,11RhOrv3Yf,10
He wants to tell us that they are coming for us.,11RhOrv3Yf,14
it means it aint over. get your popcorn and hang on. shit is going to happen. he never conceded. he never will concede and he has a whole lot of cards to play now that the whole trap has been sprung. HOLD THE LINE,11RhOrv3Yf,10
Just one more shot of hopium please,11RhOrv3Yf,8
I'm all about the hopium now.,11RhOrv3Yf,4
What is his plan do you think??,11RhOrv3Yf,2
lol. Exactly. Apparently part of his plan was to go on TV a couple days before Biden takes office and talk about peaceful transition of power and healing and concession. Clearly by the end of the week he will crush the deep state and do another 4 years./s There's no more 4D chess after you give a concession speech and tell your supporters to play nice.,11RhOrv3Yf,3
Really? And what shit would it be that prevents you and I from ever being mistreated again and why is this just happening days before leaving office? Was suffering for 4 years just part of the plan? Your optimism is not grounded in any fact I think. Trump conceded last night on live TV if you read between the lines and the sooner we let that sink in the better. We either need to rise up or accept that our nation is lost but dreaming that it will all work out at the last minute is a bit like believe in Santa at this point.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"Why would you make a tweet specifically to tell us what we already know, that we are being shit on. He could not stop that in 4 years and him claiming it will stop in the future is just to cheer us up. He couldn't stop it as POTUS and will not be able to when Biden takes office in days.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
Just scroll through facebook...people want us dead. Its crazy to me that people just follow news/MSM perspectives instead of coming up with their own.,11RhOrv3Yf,26
I've been purging all leftists from my Facebook for a while now. I have no room in my life for deranged lunatics. I only keep it up to stay in touch with family and old friends.,11RhOrv3Yf,8
I don't get it. What does he MEAN by this. I hope there's something brewing pedes!,11RhOrv3Yf,24
"I think we all need to stop waiting for Trump to do something, we need to get to work and we need to prepare.",11RhOrv3Yf,21

We can ONLY Pray... that Occurs Over the next 10 Days! President Trump you MUST do this ASAP... No more delays... No more Excuses!!!!! Once you're out of Office all of it will be Buried in the Black Hole of Government!!!! RELEASE ALL NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It will give us all the ammo we need to fight!

What are the odds that he holds that information and uses it as leverage to protect himself and his family after he leaves office? Fuck with him and it all gets released. Fuck with us and it all gets released. That way he has some leverage to ensure we get treated fairly and aren't abused. Who knows.,11RhOrv3Yf,3

"To the people that don't believe this, you are of the same mindset of loser RINO. The Democrats have made it crystal clear they will prosecute Trump and make continue to make his life a living hell.",11RhOrv3Yf,7
"That's why even if he's not president, there is a big fight going on. TNN would instantly be the biggest network on TV. With unfiltered access to 100 million people. It would be a dagger in the heart of controlled state Leftist media. It would be powerful.",11RhOrv3Yf,5
"If he doesn’t get a 2nd term, he’s dead. Do y’all realize this is not about news right now......he’s not making plans to do anything outside of the presidency because he can’t unless he’s fleeing the country",11RhOrv3Yf,7
"CNN is for sale. I would cry with glee if Trump swooped in and bought them out. Fired every piece of shit there. Then, not only would CNN be destroyed, but Fox News as well as they would steal all their viewers.",11RhOrv3Yf,3
The price is too high. It's super cheap to build a new CNN without paying for all their baggage.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
"The problem is getting on the air though. CNN has contracts that Trump would take over. What good is a cable new network that isn't on cable. And remember, Trump wouldn't be paying cash. He would come in with financing. A builder never uses their own money.",11RhOrv3Yf,1
"There is a FIGHT behind the scenes to stay alive and maintain power. In the presidency or out of it. Don't forget, Bush, Obama were puppets. The people pulling the strings are the ones with power, not the public face in the presidency. This is who Trump is fighting.",11RhOrv3Yf,0
I don’t think it’s worth it to them to do this. The establishment usually works in more nefarious subtle ways. Putting him in prison on bullshit will just rile up millions of supporters even more with what to gain? Revenge? Ego?,11RhOrv3Yf,2
I tend to agree. Why make him the worlds biggest martyr now? They are about the massively marginalize him and can fight in sneaky disgusting ways like they usually do,11RhOrv3Yf,1
What are the odds that Trump has a dead mans switch filled with the deepest darkest American secrets? Fuck with him or his family and it all gets released.,11RhOrv3Yf,1
Why do people keep saying this? He has NO life outside of this Presidency if he doesn’t get a 2nd term. He will be jailed and killed. He’s not creating anything because he won’t have freedom.,11RhOrv3Yf,8

You’ll find yourself to be much happier if you remove expectations, replace them with hope and the understanding that things will be alright, this too shall pass.

That won’t make anything better and only weaken your resolve.",11RhOrv3Yf,-1
"2024?
You don't get it do you?
There is no 2024, no 2028, no 2032 ect. If they get away with rigging this election they will just do it again and again and again.

"I absolutely get it. I've been saying for months there is no 2024 But if Trump announces he's running anyway, it does a few things: Now this alone doesn't get us to a win in 2024, because yes it is 120% rigged. I feel like in the short term it's better than him packing up and retiring, where he will promptly choke to death on a pillow",11RhOrv3Yf,6

"It always has been. 1 Samuel 8:
*8 As Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel. 2 Joel and Abijah, his oldest sons, held court in Beersheba. 3 But they were not like their father, for they were greedy for money. They accepted bribes and perverted justice. 4 Finally, all the elders of Israel met at Ramah to discuss the matter with Samuel. 5 “Look,” they told him, “you are now old, and your sons are not like you. Give us a king to judge us like all the other nations have.” 6 Samuel was displeased with their request and went to the Lord for guidance. 7 “Do everything they say to you,” the Lord replied, “for they are rejecting me, not you. They don’t want me to be their king any longer. 8 Ever since I brought them from Egypt they have continually abandoned me and followed other gods. And now they are giving you the same treatment. 9 Do as they ask, but solemnly warn them about the way a king will reign over them.” 10 So Samuel passed on the Lord’s warning to the people who were asking him for a king. 11 “This is how a king will reign over you,” Samuel said. “The king will draft your sons and assign them to his chariots and his charioteers, making them run before his chariots. 12 Some will be generals and captains in his army,[a] some will be forced to plow in his fields and harvest his crops, and some will make his weapons and chariot equipment. 13 The king will take your daughters from you and force them to cook and bake and make perfumes for him. 14 He will take away the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his own officials. 15 He will take a tenth of your grain and your grape harvest and distribute it among his officers and attendants. 16 He will take your male and female slaves and demand the finest of your cattle[b] and donkeys for his own use. 17 He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you will be his slaves. 18 When that day comes, you will beg for relief from this king you are demanding, but then the Lord will not help you.”*",11RhFVjmdN,5

Thats because BLM attacks private people and businesses. They want use fighting each other. Patriots (and probably antifa) sieged the capitol. Attacking elites is a big no-no. Us proles are not allowed to attack the Uniparty. Yesterday proved to me that we can fight and win when we want to. And that almost the entire system is corrupt.

But, we'll never win again anyway, so why bother playing? The game they want us to play is the illusion of 2 sides. Pick one side or the other. Trump was on another side we didn't know was there. Sure he ran as a Republican, but he was nothing like the GOP. Ron Paul also ran as a Republican and that was the closest he came to winning. Things are different now. Trump had/has a sizeable number of people supporting him. Supporting him not the GOP. We all know that. The Trump vote will make or break the GOP. Expect that in the next election cycle you will see a strong effort to go for the Trump base. But that will be after the next 3+ years of blaming the Trump base for literally every problem under the sun.

That's a myth that lazy people say to avoid taking responsibility.. president has the ability to sign executive orders. The president has the ability to tell regulatory agencies what regulations to impose. Neither of those need Congres,11RhOuBIlc,2

"Most white racists in 2021 are not hateful TBH. I mean, they are still racist and it's still wrong, but most of them get to that place as backlash from leftwing racism. And most of them don't wish ill on other races, they just want to be left alone. I come from a pretty liberal place and am pretty liberal for a pede. And it drives me nuts that most people I know on the two sides are really not that far apart. When I sit down and have conversations with people and really break it down it's pretty easy to see that both sides aren't that different and both sides are kind of racist in their own way. The real problem becomes when you're convinced that your racism is justice. Like.... right wing racism tends to sprout from the want to not have your culture trampled on. To live in an insulated white neighborhood and when minorities do come to ensure they conform. Whereas left wing racism wants to attack that culture because it's perceived as racist. Like... .take affirmative action. It's a great idea to give kids who didn't have private ivy league tutors a leg up in college admissions tor the want of a more diverse school. But WTF does it have to be based on color? Couldn't we base it on economic status? Letting a rich black kid with private tutors into your school isn't helping anyone that's disadvantaged. Sorry this got long.... I think both sides get race wrong... but I think this side at least gets the idea that they might be wrong sometimes. The other side just assumes it's right and that vindicates it all.",11RhOuBIlc,36
every race is allowed to have pride in their race except whites... how is that not racist?,11RhOuBIlc,61
"I get that, to some extent. When black people in America talk about black pride they talk about a shared African American heritage that often came from people who don't have home countries anymore. So they have a shared kinship from heritage with black Americans of years past. I'm always suspicious a bit when people are proud to be white. I'm not proud to be white any more than I am to have hazel eyes. I am super proud of my Scottish heritage though and have a whole bunch of crap in my house that illustrates that. And screw anybody who says otherwise. I'm also super proud of my American heritage. And a lot of that boils down to being proud of a lot of white guys that came before me.... but I'm not proud of my melanin count. I dunno if that makes sense, maybe I'm just rambling now :P I tend to not think of white/black as things most of the time though. Like... it'd be weird AF to me if my black friend from Trinidad felt some strong pride in Rosa Parks. I get why African Americans do though. But you're from Trinidad, she's not your heritage. My friend doesn't feel that way. But I'm just using it as an example. Like... I don't feel any more proud of ancient Vikings than I do of any other random ancient white people or other colors. But I sing my kids a Scottish lullaby at bedtime.",11RhOuBIlc,-17
The shared african american experience of having real institutional racism in their favor? Fuck all your nonsense. If white pride is bad then so is black pride. Being proud of the color of your skin is asinine.,11RhOuBIlc,13
Being proud of the color of your skin is asinine. I just said that. Being proud of your heritage is what it should be. Black people who are descendants of slaves should be proud of being African Americans. Not proud of being black. I 100% agree.,11RhOuBIlc,1
"By your logic they are proud of their heritage then they should be celebrating their own countries, i.e. kenya, ghana, angola, etc... and not skin color either. White skin relates back to European heritage and culture just as much as black skin relates to African heritage and culture.",11RhOuBIlc,3
"What I'm saying is that the slave trade did, in many ways, cut off their connection to their countries. That said, I don't disagree with you. I just don't feel any affinity to white countries to which I have no connection. My family comes from like 6 or 7 white countries so I feel a connection there.",11RhOuBIlc,0
"Kamala is Jamaican and Indian yet she plays the black card.. they all do and how much black is black when it comes to reparations? or free loans to college.. half gets half a check? 1/32 still get something? it is a total psyop. so turn it around.. when whites are minorities which they are in many situations in the world, do they get any favors?",11RhOuBIlc,1
I'm not for any of that crap. All I said is I get why African Americans feel pride in African American history. It's because they don't have home countries. That's as far as I went though. I don't think they should get special treatment. It's racist.,11RhOuBIlc,1
"People want their belief system accepted by society. What you are saying sounds like a cope, sorry. Your genes are your ancestry, they are not a melanin count. Only white talk like this. By the way, your Trinidad friend takes pride in Rosa Parks. He just doesn't tell you.",11RhOuBIlc,1
"A cope? I'm not familiar with the term. My genes ARE my ancestry, but they don't include all white people. That's all I mean to say. I personally think that, for the most part, things like Asian pride is dumb AF. How can you feel pride in Asian accomplishments? Does a Chinese person feel pride in the Japanese Nanking Massacre? I mean.... most Asian families I know hate the other Asian races and then still say Asian Pride. Like WTF? I honestly don't get any of it.",11RhOuBIlc,3

"This is true, I've got a Dominican friend who's hung out with white supremacists and he said they were chill people who had no issues hanging out with him, they just wouldn't want him to move into their neighborhood.

"I'm reminded of a quote from a Thomas Sowell book. He mentions being born in the south, but raised in Harlem by other family members. He didn't know people came in any other color. until he saw a white person in Harlem for the first time. A lot of people really don't understand how segregated the US was and it wasn't just in the South. White people were always going to Harlem at night for the clubs, but never lived there. Parents used to tell their daughters that black men would attack them if they went to these places to keep them from going. This was NYC and not that long ago. That city has a loooooong history of segregation.",11RhOuBIlc,4
"The Northeast is more segregated than the South in many respects. At least in the South people had familiarity. When MLK visited Chicago he said it was the most racist place he’d been. Funnily enough, I heard from an old timer that some black people thought any white person coming up to Harlem way back in the day was a druggie or promiscuous and to be avoided.",11RhOuBIlc,3
"Oh, yes. there's a grain of truth in that. Rarely did you see anyone not black in Harlem. If you did, it was so they could get their drug of choice, which was easily accessed through the entertainment in these clubs. It really picked up in the 20s, when women's dress lengths rose and a new type of woman, the flapper, was born. She was most definitely testing the boundaries and her parent's patience with what they saw as her new immorality. Prohibition hit in 1918 and things went underground. But getting back to your last sentence, messing with a white woman/man whose parents were wealthy and politically connected could get you into trouble. You know, people really do not give jazz/popular/blues music the credit they deserve for bringing two types of people, who would have never met or socialized, together.",11RhOuBIlc,3
"Lol nobody is being racist because of just skin color, that's naive liberal take. People judge other groups of people based on aggregate statistics, despite being 13% of the population, blacks commit over 50% of the violent crimes (probably even higher if you're counting all crimes), blacks commit 99% of interracial rapes between blacks and whites, while you might be able find one white man raping black women in a good year. if there are four blacks on the street corner at night, I'd avoid them regardless of how they dressed. Heck they can all be albinos wearing thousand-dollar suits and I'd still avoid them like the plague.",11RhOuBIlc,3
"The right are race sensitive, not racist. People like to conflate the two, because it's to their advantage to do so. The only reason there's a discussion about racism at all is because the right are race sensitive and want to be fair. That doesn't happen in racist countries, they're just racists. They don't even think about racism as an idea. You're inferior and that's that. Back in my day, the actual straight up racists, neo-nazis, skinheads that we would run into. When you'd get one of them alone, the story was always the same, some black guy beat them up. That racism didn't last very long, after they grew up and got some internal perspective. What people consider racism now is actually a smaller part of a larger concept that has nothing to do with race at all. It's like how microaggressions are a tiny piece of a larger concept that only applies to the thing they want.",11RhOuBIlc,11

Next comes ""Fat People Hate"" which maybe was 'offensive' but had the right to exist the same way 'quityourbullshit, OKRetard, ShitTumblrSays etc.' has the right to exist. (Also I am of the school of thought that fat shaming is a needed evil just like slut shaming, alcohol shaming, drug shaming especially being a former alcoholic/drug addict) then from there it quickly snowballs into anyone and anything that Reddit demmed 'offensive'.

Overnight it became a propaganda cesspool. No matter what happens I'll forever thank the mods for building tdw and giving us at least a year's worth of a freedom platform.",11RhOuBIlc,22
"Reddit loved Ron Paul purely because he was going to legalize pot. Then in 2016 those same people went for Bernie Sanders because marijuana, plus a little free college thrown in.

"These were results of the Ellen Pao monetization plan. She came in and went on a recruiting spree to bring in her people.

Ellen's people stayed and shit up the place with a sprinkling of glitter and spritz of pinterest. Sanitized to the lowest common denominator of most authoritarian communist country. And you've got a deformed gimp reddit 2.0 product nobody but marketing teams, bots, and disinfo agents could tolerate. The great mods are gone. The community builders. The professionals hobbying for free together in that space. When Google results returned pages of results sorted by highest marketing budget, you could research almost any product or problem on reddit and get authentic comment in far faster time. The value was honest sentiment analysis of the general public. This was a supercharged pool for rapid exchange of ideas, improving the human. They polluted and destroyed that reservoir of information and imagination. That was their killer feature and value.

I go there maybe once a month or so, typically due to search results reg. technical stuff, and the format there seems much worse than it used to (and many more overt ads, though I guess that is the monetization kicking in). The reddit model itself tends to have both advantages and issues, which you can see in various ways in some of the reddit-like sites. Hidden promoters, artificial upvote/downvote-opinion-shaping, some comments that were benign being unintentionally hidden, etc. I think this site is very good at avoiding some of these, (much) better than other reddit-like sites I have seen overall, but definitely not all these issues.

Without us, they eat each other and turn each other in to the gulags they all begged and pleaded for from their Tech Overlords who were all to happy to oblige.

Now the government is handling fiat currency badly and we have a problem again. Just going back to gold standard wouldn't mean it is handled better this time however.

"Honestly I don't really disagree with you. But a lot of the younger generation seem somewhat based, they see the fake news and the censorship and it seems insane to them. A lot of the current kids of millennials also see their parents massively overreacting to little things and think it's crazy.

Fuck Reddit then. Their funeral.,11RhOuBIlc,77
"Reddit died sometime between 2015 and 2017. Something just changed. Idk what it was but when I first went there in 2012 it had this freewheeling, Ron Paul loving, call OP a faggot kind of energy. Sure there were commies and losers a-plenty, but somewhere along the line it just became the world's largest astroturf.",11RhOuBIlc,42

Ellen Pao. No coincidences...,11RhOuBIlc,9
"They did buy both Politics sub, and Bernie sub. I recall the mod of Bernie who was the guy who created the sub as far as 2011 or earlier, announced that he will be part of Bernie campaign and therefore he can no longer mod the sub. So he is interducing few mods he trusted. They then backstabed the movement. They prohibited talking trash about Hillary, and always froze the sub so to focus on phone calls ( which mostly were fake numbers) Then the moment Bernie lost, they froze the sub because he Bernie is no longer relevant. Very dirty game.",11RhOuBIlc,2
"One last thing, Hillary sub was a dead sub. 10 comments per day is the average.",11RhOuBIlc,1
The whole Ellen Pao thing is when reddit really jumped the shark. I was there for over 10 years.,11RhOuBIlc,9
"I used reddit casually at best in the past - The_donald, on election night 2016 is the only time I went near any political forums. I went to a couple gaming forums, and the Opie and Anthony sub, until that show imploded and the sub for it lost it's damned mind. Which is what fans of that show did anyway. But show me an era, or forum, or any circumstance where liberals have been able to tolerate free speech, and haven't tried to immediately take over any forum or gathering of people and imposing themselves on it. Everyone is rightly concerned about the Dem controlled government going after the 2nd. But I'm also seriously concerned about them going after the 1st. They're outright saying conservatives and GOP should be punished, if not outlawed. They've always muttered it, but now they're being open about it. And that scares the living shit out of me.",11RhOuBIlc,4

"Their current narrative is Trump incited all the violence, so naturally they feel they can now ban anything at all related to him on their shitty ass site.",11RhOuBIlc,24
Yeah it really goes to show how far they are willing to run with a narrative,11RhOuBIlc,12
Won't be much longer. They'll have us completely silenced and sent to death camps.,11RhOuBIlc,3
"They censored his video calling for peaceful protest because it's counter-narrative. So they never had any intention of actually quelling violence, if they did they would have kept the 'peace' message visible.",11RhOuBIlc,3

"Just come here then, Reddit is shit.",11RhOuBIlc,22
"This site needs more communities. I want to post about normal every day shit, not politics 24/7. There's so much noise here it ranges from retarded to autistic most of the time. Reddit was successful originally because it was able to cut down the noise by laser focusing topics into subgroups and provided 1 front page to view the top things from each subgroup. It replaced RSS feeds. Why? Because people want to comment on shit. People want to call out shit. People want to be spoonfed everything, because the average person sucks. I'll say it again. The average person sucks. They are stupid, lazy, and sheep. Look at places lke Chic-Fil-A - lines wrapping around the building daily, past the building and down the street, despite it only taking them <30 seconds to serve 1 person/car. Every fucking day. The average person doesn't want to learn to cook or be bothered with anything, they want to stuff their fat faces and sit on their ass. 60% of America is obese. You think these fat fucks are gonna do shit? Nope! When the United States was formed it was something like 3% of the population that actually participated in the revolution. The average person didn't get involved. Maybe they couldn't. Maybe they were scared. Whatever, they didn't participate. It's just he pareto principle in action. The square root of the the total number of people in anything are the only people who actually do shit. Gab's Dissenter system works great for that but it lacks the numbers - because it's not super dead simple retarded to sign up. Reddit was, and still sorta is, super dead simple to sign up. You can be the biggest dumbass on earth and still figure out how to create a reddit account. Anyhow. If there is going to be any type of revolution happening to fix the swamp, the average person isn't going to be involved. It's going to be <10% of the population made up of highly motivated and skilled individuals. Trump supporters will stay on reddit because at the end of the day, most of them are just average people. We can appreciate their words and show of support, but none of them are actually going to ever do anything for this country. spez: fixed %",11RhOuBIlc,25

Not to mention these big businesses who will join in on it. Pretty sure we haven't seen nothing yet compared to what's probably coming in the coming months and the year.

He never called for breaking into the capitol. My guess was the idea was just to have a huge peaceful protest while the vote was going on .. one that could be heard inside the walls of the capitol.. but instead, the fuckin weasels were already fully blasting through the votes and process.

I just wrote something similar in another thread. Yesterday was only about .01% of patriots that showed up in DC. All of those politicians do live in a bubble and have no clue what they’ve done now.

However when you actually show that you understand it is the corrupt politicians that are the real problem and they are your target, then they worry. Life is all about choices, these corrupt politicians make their choices to screw over the little guy, to be corrupt and to approve stolen elections. On the other side there are 75 Million people that know what they have done, that are patriots and it just takes a single one of those 75 Million to make a choice to settle a score.

They wait until their kid or grandkids, that never cared for dads guns inherits them. He figures he doesn't want them after dad dies, so he’ll just turn them in at the next buyback. After all, most of the gun and ammo companies dried up because no one could afford a 30% gun tax and 50% ammo tax all those years ago. And even if he wanted to shoot them, ammo is $5 a shot now, from the new taxes and scarcity. But at least dad didnt comply and we got to sell all those evil guns for a few hundred and get them off the streets too! A win win! (Kinda like that, but in chinese)",11RhFVkcNi,1

"Counter insurgency 101: the best way to kill a populist movement is to alienate the public from it. Everything truly American will now be regarded as dangerous if not outright insane. Dissent now presents a very real and active threat, individualism and Liberty threaten public health, capitalism threatens world peace and nationalism in any form is dangerous. We were played, Trump was picked to generate chaos and crisis, his concession in the next week will prove this. I’d be pissed if I hadn’t predicted this in 2017, now I just think its hilarious how easy we are to manipulate. It’s like Eddie Blake said in Watchmen: ""Once you realize what a joke everything is, being the Comedian's is the only thing that makes sense."" There is no more appropriate quote given the ruling class are literally running with Ozymandias’s plan for world unity, i.e. the Great Reset.",11RhFVkcNi,6

God you guys are dense. That's now how it's going to play out. Everyone always assumes that the borders are going to remain the borders. Like borders are set in stone and governments are set in stone. What a very American attitude. America will fall sooner or later. Right now the politicians have chosen sooner. You now have the choice to fight to prevent that fall or hasten its arrival.,11RhFVkcNi,2
Trump was not some long term plan to hand the world to globalists. They were going to do this anyway. Trump woke up tens of millions of people. Under Hillary or some Republicuck all the pieces would have moved towards the Great Reset in complete silence with no obstacles.

"Long post so I apologise in advance but this needs to be said and read.
Congress didn't even get a taste of what could come upon them. The only reason that they don't fear us is because they know we have things to lose..... Our homes that we fight or flight to pay off those mortgages, our families, our so called rights (that they afford us). I heard Mittens say last night, dramatically, that what happened was an insurrection, obviously we all know that he grossly over exaggerated. If we wanted insurrection we would've been armed. These fuckers used us last night and it's evident by their rhetoric. They used us to quell the storm that was mounted against them since the election, think about it how many phone calls and emails did each of you send these fuckers about the FRAUD?!? I know I spent hours everyday doing so and give them hell each and every one. So they placated us saying we're going to object, last count I saw was 150 in the house and 12 in the Senate. Then they used the ""insurrection"" as an excuse to cut cuck out. So they could validate and use this instance to put through their steal again in the dead and cover of night like they did in their FRAUD. While we slept they pushed their second FRAUD through. Gentlemen we've been had. There was no violence yesterday no churches or buildings torched just a couple of broken windows and some camera equipment put in a pile, there was no looting, no vandalism, even one of our own lost her life because of them.....shit if we were BLM we would've burnt down all of DC and hung those POSs high from a tree. Maybe it wasn't only the politicians that CUCKED out.",11RhFVkcNi,4

It's the Federal Government that has grown out of control and we no longer recognize as legitimate."" People need to assert their 10th Amendment rights. Those are YOUR rights, not STATES rights like dipshit GOP phrase it. You have the right to form, join, and maintain the kind of community you want to. And pencil dicks like Adam Schiff shouldn't have a god damn say over what your community looks like. And the precedent for this has already been set. States and cities have decided to ignore federal drug and immigration laws for over a decade, what's being suggested down is a simple escalation of that. Declare that Federal Agencies like DOJ, FBI, ATF, etc etc are barred from enforcing federal laws and regulations in your state. Forcibly close all federal buildings, and charge federal agents for Obstruction of Justice and Kidnapping for any attempted enforcement of Federal Law. Tell them when there's Federal Standards for Election Security INCLUDING Voter ID that you'll CONSIDER allowing Federal Agents back into your state. All that is lacking is the willpower to do this on the GOP side. DNC do this shit all the time.

The thing is though, everyone seemed to be on the same page that we were going to go into the Capital. I dont see what is so scandalous about that.

We did start yanking Police officers out when we had the opportunity because pushing wasnt getting us anywhere, but despite 3 getting yanked into a crowd of ""dangerous rioters"" everytime they got helped up, given water and allowed out.

Don’t forget how bad they have had it over the last year trying to protect OUR businesses and cities. They have been demoralized, many of them have quit, many more might.",11RhFaHeMh,5
"They are “appalled” but they still punch in every shift. Don’t let them get away with that weasel explanation. You’re part of the problem or part of the solution. I know some nice cops, too. Some slave drivers were considered the “decent ones.” They still knew who signed their payslips.",11RhFaHeMh,2
"Yup, but MUH THIN BLUE LINE. 🤣 Blue line dick suckers here are the worst IMHO. If the reaction to the last few months events by LEO all around the country have t woken people up to the truth, nothing will. You are on your own, and if you dare to do the job of enforcing and following the constitution, they will make you pay. You may beat the rap, but you won’t beat the ride that the state and the media put you though. Remember, the process is the punishment. Contrary to the popular belief here, LEO are not our friends. They are the HR department for the government on steroids. If you’re an exemplary citizen/employee that somehow causes any type of stress/heartache for the government/company, they will do everything in their power to destroy you even if what you are doing is morally right and/or makes them follow their own company polices, that they refuse to abide by(oath to the constitution). This is often done in order to save/siphon money and/or protect other protected class employees/citizens while establishing more control and power over anyone willing to stand up for themselves. Don’t believe me, just look at what has gone on since chyna flu/Fent Floyd has gone on. Even before that, look what has been done to GEOTUS, Flynn, and Stone among others. It’s blatantly obvious. There is also the issue of job security. Self reliance by citizens is not in the PD's own best interest so they'll come down on any citizen doing for themselves, orders or not. They're no different from any other government agency that require people to be totally reliant on them for their own selfish interests. Unfortunately when the third world is running wild in the first world, first world justice is no longer applicable. Add the fact that the “justice” system has been subverted and isn’t and can no longer work as intended, and we live in 🤡🌎. The justice system and its “enforcers” have proven time and time again that they actually protect the morally corrupt criminals from the moral law abiding citizenry while at the same time penalizing and arresting them for enforcing morality that the state refuses to. We all have to stop living in the world the way we wish it was and start living in it the way it actually is. 🤷🏼‍♂️ My reply to another post on the issue. “ Go check my history If you still believe I don’t know what the large majority of what street/beat cops deal with. I know all to well the type of animals encounter and general evil and hatred they receive at any given time/encounter. I also never said all cops everywhere are enforcing mask laws all the time. I’m saying there are examples out there even on video where one POS LEO does push the issue and his coworkers back him instead of calling him out on his bullshit. Shame by your peers and equals is a hell of a deterrent, and we have very little of that in many if not all of said cases. These are the LEOs that make up the majority of the problem in this country IMHO. It’s not the ones we see and witness doing the actual unconstitutional and cowardice acts, but the ones who just stand by and allow it to happen, and that makes up at least, and I think I’m being kind with this figure, 50% of LEO that participate in the system in any capacity from the top to the bottom. I’m talking Judges, DAs, and all the way down to street level LEOs. I know you’re not going to like this, but the agnostic/fence sitting LEOs are not the only reason, but a huge part of the reason they are in the situation they’re in now IMHO. They thought they were going to be able to just keep on coasting by without picking the side of morality and their oath to the constitution and that their elected communists masters wouldn’t throw them under the bus. THEY WERE WRONG!!! They made their bed and now they’re are being forced to lie in it, unfortunately many good moral LACs are suffering because of it also, and I’m sure there will be many more. You will never understand how difficult it is for me to say these things, but I never avoid the harsh unapologetic truths. I’m not happy about the state of affairs in this country, but I understand why it is happening, and why it had to happen, and I’m just glad it happened sooner than later so we actually still have a chance to correct it.“",11RhFaHeMh,1

"What you need are deliberate, logical and methodical strategies that, once executed, lay waste to their attempted retaliation. Within the confines of the law and the American Constitution, there are many laws that are simply unknown to most. Making use of these as well as other methods, one can thereby create a highly effective, chain-linked strategy to deliver a crushing blow, all at once. The key is to become a master strategist. The more specific your questions are, the better you are at delivering these hammers with maximum effect at the right time. Ex: Enemy does A. You could come back with B - this would be expected. He might even think that you come back with a variant of B or even C. But he may not expect for you to jump to J, back to B, and then finish on H. Don't finish back on A. This is what Sun-Tzu means when he says that, ""Generals go to wars that they've already won"" (or something to that effect). You've developed a strategy that is both steel, yet malleable and open to change as the landscape shifts. If you can do this consistently, you win wars without ever fighting. This is what we want. A linear retaliation simply means that you're playing his game, on his terms, always. Politics is influence within the confines of the law - and even there the DNC would disagree.",11RhFaHeMh,9

"As long as we let the media have so much control of us and our relatives perhaps, but there's a reason it was 1776 and not 1775 or 1774, beatings and humiliations build a mutual resolve and will and the bureaucrats that want power are so oblivious to what they're doing. The one terrible thing about this site and some of the movement is how dismissive they are about large portions of Americans. We need to come together, act with love to them, not rub anything in their face and be humble. A lot of folks that initially hated Trump could have been over if folks weren't waving red flags at them, mocking them.",11RhFaHeMh,2
"Anyone who believes we are going to get our Rights and Republic back without violence, which yesterday WAS NOT, is fooling themselves... They that have power believe that we serve them and not them us, they will not go down without a fight and they will use everything at their disposal. They own the voting machines so you cannot vote them out. They can stifle your speech and ban you from the ability to speak. Nothing more dangerous than a man with nothing to lose.
When you make a peaceful change impossible, you make a violent revolution inevitable. Our government serves at our pleasure and if the People want to change it and make a new one that will protect the rights of the people it is not only our right to do so but it is our duty to do so. If they will not obey their oaths and they will not go peacefully they will have to be removed in any manner. The longer we wait the more violence it will take to remove them later. I saw what happened yesterday as the People telling our Servants that we can come and take you out. It was a reminder to Congress that they serve us and we will ensure they obey or will. It was not to hurt anyone or destroy anything it was a non-violent attempt to prove to them that we can take back our nation from rogue servants and traitors at will. The fight is coming soon, I don't know what the breaking point will be for the masses to all move but they are coming. Biden will try to take guns with force, will that do it? Food shortages are coming and millions will starve, will that do it? Millions will lose their homes and be homeless soon, will that be enough? With the Covid19 hoax and people complying they have put the nation on house arrest and taken their jobs if they declared you were not essential. Some people are already fighting back against Covid mandates and cops trying to enforce them., will they push to far? Will it be what they do to Trump that finally moves the people to say enough? I am praying for peace. I do not condone violence. I am just stating some facts and wondering when, if ever, the People will say enough and do what they will have to to remove the corrupt systems and persons and take back their powers.",11RhFaHeMh,5
The Trump supporters are about to peacefully get their houses taken while being marched into Gulags saying “see I’m not dangerous or racist. I’m complying” as they continue to call them racist and dangerous.,11RhFaHeMh,5

I'm not talking about twitter or fb....I'm saying that the police for example have their walkie talkies and their earbuds that keep them synced up as one unit. We need something similar. I firmly believe that if we create another demonstration and we have this means of communication, we will not be easily dispersed like we were yesterday.",11RhFaHeMh,4

At some point one has to realize that we could have the biggest moral high ground in the world and the media will still continue to lie, slander, and misrepresent us, and the people will eat that garbage up like sugar.

"The main difference between BLM/Antifa and us is that they actually fight for what they believe in. They laid siege to the White House, took over entire neighborhoods / set up autonomous zones, occupied dozens of government buildings, burned down police stations and federal courthouses, toppled statues, vandalized monuments and memorials, etc., and they did all this because a violent criminal died of a fentanyl overdose.

Thousands of trump supporters marched on the capitol peacefully Then the proud boys or patriot prayer fuckers broke down the barricade to the laen and spent 2 hours encouraging people to storm the lawn. Wich they did. They filled itt Then it was only a handful of young nick fuentes types that broke the second barricade and entered the capitol. Almost everyone was either on the laen peacefully singing the national anthem or behind the lawn on the public streett Even the ones who stormed the building didnt hurt anybody.. they took selfies Blm burned down a courthouse and anti kavanaugh rioters stormed the capitol more violentlyy Dont believe the fake news and u better be on twitter chastisin EVERY rightwing reporter who goes along with cnns talkin points,11RhFWr5QS,49
The police clearly put a show on one side of the building keeping people away while letting them in the other side without much resistance. The overwhelming majority of the crowd stayed away from the capitol,11RhFWr5QS,47

The photos that are circulating about the Viking guy being Antifa, they are deceptively editing out his SIGN at the BLM event. His sign said ""Q SENT ME"". Who edited that out? Wasn't a Trump supporter editing that out. Wasn't a Patriot editing that out. They are trying to turn us on our own revolution.

"You mad, bro? Those people yesterday were just following your advice and protesting via direct action. You people claim that there's no higher form of patriotism than engaging in protest against ""fascism"". You're just upset that a mob of weaponized intersectional feminism majors couldn't burn down a Federal Courthouse in Portland after three months while a bunch of sightseers breached the Capitol Building for selfies with Capitol Hill Police in less than one hour.

A highly disturbed individual like McVeigh kills 168 people, but the people your ideology supports, from every form of left wing statist experiment since 1917, has resulted in the deaths of over 100 million people. They didn't die in a senseless truck bomb blast in an act of instantaneous evil, they died in state ordained cruelty and misery over the span of decades, some of which, like in China, is occurring even today. To obscure the fact that your ideology is intellectually bankrupt and immoral, you instead project your neurosis onto anyone you happen to disagree with politically. We're all ""McVeighs"" while you wish for the death and destruction of 75,000,000 people who didn't vote for Joe Biden and for the actions of a few people who got caught up in the moment and followed along with someone's bad idea yesterday. Yet you don't apologize for the outright terrorism of innocent people living in innocent communities by BLM/Antifa last year simply because Orange Man Bad.

"This. Some of the cops were helpful. Some were assholes. Some saw people pushing in anyway and were like ""Fuck it"".

"The protestors yesterday were just doing what the left did during the Kavanaugh hearings. They occupied the Capitol (after they were let in!), but were never a threat. They weren't even armed. The problem is that the left controls the narrative. They declare which protests are peaceful or not and which riots are justified or not. Peak clown world.",11RhFWr5QS,123
"President Trump said that the FAKE NEWS suppression media is the biggest problem at the rally. Basically, protesting doesn’t really work for us because of this. The media just spins any protest as a win for themselves. In the same way it doesn’t matter how many votes we win by, because their strategy is to just wait until we’re done counting and then add in enough fake ballots to “win”, it also doesn’t matter how peaceful we are, because they will just claim we are violent, or intimidating, or “a threat to democracy”. Even if President Trump issues a video calling for peace, they just delete the video and don’t report it. Then they say “he refuses to call for peace”. And then the corporations repeat it on every channel nonstop. If you go on social media and try to share the video, they suspend you and delete your account.",11RhFWr5QS,68

And those are only the votes he was given credit for.,11RhFWr5QS,27
2016 those votes were siphoned off the total too. Then even more in 2020 were siphoned. Looking at 90 million legit votes,11RhFWr5QS,12

"They'll just flag everyone as having an outstanding warrant or enough federal records to preclude you from passing any time of background check ever again. Number 1 allows you to be filtered up naturally as you have incidental contact with the Police. Even a small town sheriff pulling you over for a tail light is going to take you in for an outstanding federal warrant. It'll happen piecemeal and over time, decentralised and slowly.

knowing that the odds were long.
in their bones it was wrong.
For the rules of liberty did congress flout
So patriots came, to call them to account. Upon the capitol they did walk.
with no other intentions, but to talk.
Nary a court would have their say.
Their last hopes, that Pence would save the day. Soon their hopes were dashed.
Just like their ballots trashed. Thus they did proceed to take the floor.
Just so they could not ignore.
The elites they panicked in their fear.
As the unarmed patriots brought up the rear. Then in their ire, they had their pigs lash out.
So they shot that unarmed girl for no other reason,
Then she deigned to call them on their treason. Rally patriots, as there will be no balm,
so long as freedom lost let there be no calm. Always remember, they'll take your wealth.
They'll control your health.

They're just driving a narrative. Everything the senators are saying is meant to drive the orange man bad narrative. They've seized control of the narrative by shutting down Trump's Twitter.

"If you don’t get it yet, you’ll never get it. I’ll try and help you understand though with one of my previous post. Yup, but MUH THIN BLUE LINE. 🤣 Blue line dick suckers here are the worst IMHO. If the reaction to the last few months events by LEO all around the country have t woken people up to the truth, nothing will. You are on your own, and if you dare to do the job of enforcing and following the constitution, they will make you pay. You may beat the rap, but you won’t beat the ride that the state and the media put you though. Remember, the process is the punishment. Contrary to the popular belief here, LEO are not our friends. They are the HR department for the government on steroids. If you’re an exemplary citizen/employee that somehow causes any type of stress/heartache for the government/company, they will do everything in their power to destroy you even if what you are doing is morally right and/or makes them follow their own company polices, that they refuse to abide by(oath to the constitution). This is often done in order to save/siphon money and/or protect other protected class employees/citizens while establishing more control and power over anyone willing to stand up for themselves. Don’t believe me, just look at what has gone on since chyna flu/Fent Floyd has gone on. Even before that, look what has been done to GEOTUS, Flynn, and Stone among others. It’s blatantly obvious. There is also the issue of job security. Self reliance by citizens is not in the PD's own best interest so they'll come down on any citizen doing for themselves, orders or not. They're no different from any other government agency that require people to be totally reliant on them for their own selfish interests. Unfortunately when the third world is running wild in the first world, first world justice is no longer applicable. Add the fact that the “justice” system has been subverted and isn’t and can no longer work as intended, and we live in 🤡🌎. The justice system and its “enforcers” have proven time and time again that they actually protect the morally corrupt criminals from the moral law abiding citizenry while at the same time penalizing and arresting them for enforcing morality that the state refuses to. We all have to stop living in the world the way we wish it was and start living in it the way it actually is. 🤷🏼‍♂️ My reply to another post on the issue. “ Go check my history If you still believe I don’t know what the large majority of what street/beat cops deal with. I know all to well the type of animals encounter and general evil and hatred they receive at any given time/encounter. I also never said all cops everywhere are enforcing mask laws all the time. I’m saying there are examples out there even on video where one POS LEO does push the issue and his coworkers back him instead of calling him out on his bullshit. Shame by your peers and equals is a hell of a deterrent, and we have very little of that in many if not all of said cases. These are the LEOs that make up the majority of the problem in this country IMHO. It’s not the ones we see and witness doing the actual unconstitutional and cowardice acts, but the ones who just stand by and allow it to happen, and that makes up at least, and I think I’m being kind with this figure, 50% of LEO that participate in the system in any capacity from the top to the bottom. I’m talking Judges, DAs, and all the way down to street level LEOs. I know you’re not going to like this, but the agnostic/fence sitting LEOs are not the only reason, but a huge part of the reason they are in the situation they’re in now IMHO. They thought they were going to be able to just keep on coasting by without picking the side of morality and their oath to the constitution and that their elected communists masters wouldn’t throw them under the bus. THEY WERE WRONG!!! They made their bed and now they’re are being forced to lie in it, unfortunately many good moral LACs are suffering because of it also, and I’m sure there will be many more. You will never understand how difficult it is for me to say these things, but I never avoid the harsh unapologetic truths. I’m not happy about the state of affairs in this country, but I understand why it is happening, and why it had to happen, and I’m just glad it happened sooner than later so we actually still have a chance to correct it.“",11RhAsTBIt,8
"I get it. I understand where I was going. In a perfect world, what I said would be the police would get it. I know this is not a perfect world. I know how they are playing this game. I went to school for Homeland Security and Emergency Management and quickly found how against law enforcement they really are. I was a Park Ranger for NPS and had many opportunities to be in law enforcement. I know the game that's played and has been for years. The point, anything you thought you knew, was a lie. There are good cops, but there's a system there.",11RhAsTBIt,1

Fuck anybody calling it terrorism or unpatriotic and fuck any GOP member condemning it.. there were thousands and thousands of patriotic peaceful protesters that came to support Trump and to oppose biden.. they showed up they marched for him and they peacefully protested outside the capital.. a couple dozen young kids we're let in and took selfies inside.. the same GOP that refused to call Black lives matter terrorism. They refused to act against antifa burning down cities and literally seceding from the nation when they created their autonomous zone.. those same GOP calling Trump a trader and calling his supporters terrorists for walking inside a building even though anti-kavanaugh protesters did the same thing in 201 Fuck any of them. The Patriots that traveled from across the country to support Trump on January 6th were better men than anybody in the media or Congress or any of these turncoat Republican voter traders saying that they were wrong.. fuck these people. it's the same thing they did at charlottesville. Regular Americans protesting the removal of statues and a handful of white supremacists show up and suddenly they condemn everybody? The difference is there were no white supremacistss I would go as far to say that they should do it again.. protest again. Every week. Month after month until Joe Biden is removed from office. and any Republican senator and Congress person that refuses to oppose Joe Biden and impeach him? Remove those people. They don't deserve to hold office.. Remember.. the people marching in DC represented the American people. They represented the conservative base. Congress is supposed to represent you. You are not supposed to represent congress. If the things Congress is saying and doing are out of line with what you're saying and doing? They are not representn,11RhFcX3h4,31

I read an article somewhere, popular leftist science journal - ""what if we could cure religion? Scientists find a potential way to use nano-rebots to reprogram believers!"" In the comment sections, people were talking about Republicans, and southerners. They see potential in this to make us like them. This is the end game. They really believe in that shit, stop thinking they just want money... They waste money to prevent us from any meaningful life fulfillment (destroying nuclear family, taxation, etc).",11RhFcX3h4,6
"I realize that the useful idiots legit believe all that rubbish. It's a cult, and the people in the lower ranks of the cults always believe.

They describe all religion as a means of controlling the stupid ignorant masses, and insist that the people at the top don't really believe in any of it; they just want power and control. Therefore. And I said nothing about money. Money is just a channel for the power they want; the ultimate objective is to concentrate all property and rights in the hands of a few apotheotic elites, who will then lord over everyone else, reward those who please them, and punish those who fail to conform. THAT is the end game. The malignant narcissist will accept nothing less.",11RhFcX3h4,3
"Sorry I just ranted a bit too much lol. But I would not say it's a cult, I would say it's a disease of the mind. Douglas Murray and Gad Saad talks about that often. So I don't think it's a cult, it's more like an ideology that spreads like a virus, a parasite. It is VERY infectious for a specific kind of people, once infected it takes over you like and it is over, there is no cure for this. That's why you see very pretty women 5 years ago, and you look at their transformation into feminism and now they look horrible, they've cut their tits, pink hair, piercings, etc. Just search for ""before and after feminism"" picture, here;'s an example: https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Ft1RUekb4mN8%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1 So you have to review your analysis of the cult thing, think about it more in terms of a mind-virus that has now spread to 50% of the population, and the Democrats in congress, Governors like Gavin Newsom, the NYC mayor, as well as some Republicans (Fox's Chris Wallace), have been totally affected by it.",11RhFcX3h4,1

You might say they are wrong, they don't know the truth!!!! But you won't be able to convince them of that, they are woke and they think we are wrong. It's a fight that can only result in a stalemate. Every time. Republicans are the thin line composed of small biz owners, middle class, nuclear family units with jobs. The rest, you can enumerate them. They're the Dem's constituents. They are woke, meaning that they are buying and supporting the SJW agenda, the covid lockdowns, etc. You. Cannot. Deprogram. Them. You. Can. Only. Divorce/split/secede because they hate you MORE than we hate them. They even dream of a cure to conservatism, they hope one day they can cure us of our hate towards ""the other"", a cure for our bigotry.

"Yesterday caused us to lose Trumpian support in congress. There's definitely a bigger picture, but I'm not sure it's looking better after yesterday. We need to start by articulating a platform that goes beyond Trump.",11RhFcX3h4,-5
"Correction: We didn't lose the support of congress (which was illusory to begin with). Congress and the Republican party lost the support of us. Everyone knows that the republican party is finished. It couldn't afford low turnout as it is. At this point, it will be lucky not to have 50% loss in its voters even after all the scare tactics starts. We need to start a new party to capture all the voters that the republicans have permanently lost, and to steal the voters they have left.",11RhFcX3h4,7
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! You're a fucking idiot. You need to be brainwashed again just to think straight,11RhFcX3h4,2
"Maybe not our intention, but... We destroyed the GOP. We made them take a side and it literally will kill their cancer-like grasp on our political system. We needed a blueprint on how to build back better and we got it. We will no longer elect Rinos with no courage. Kelly Loeffler is the polar opposite of what we want for our future. Her beliefs are so flimsy they can be changed by a few hours of rebel rousing. This change of “heart” would never have happened to a person of value. Look for those who stood firm. These are our prototypes for the future.",11RhFcX3h4,5
It’s ironic she was an owner of a WNBA team as the political move she will be remembered for is a flop.,11RhFcX3h4,2
I too am curious to know what we actually accomplished yesterday.,11RhFcX3h4,0
"They drove our defective government out of the building that acts as the seat of power for congress in the US. From a storybook standpoint, that narrative is exactly what American patriots will ultimately accomplish. Get these traitors out of government. And it was so so easy to accomplish! Tens of thousands of patriots showed up in DC and surrounded the nation's capitol. And only a few hundred of them, while unarmed, took less than 20 minutes to enter into a building that the American public has been barred from for decades. They forced congress out while the house and senate were in session and had unrestricted run of the place, every room, every floor, every inch, including the house and senate floors and the congressmen's private chambers, for over an hour before they all left peacefully of their own accord. In short, America owned that building. They just waltzed in and put our government into retreat. Now imagine what the rest of the patriots in DC could do if they were armed. There are an estimated 30 thousand protesters in DC and they're still there right now. If armed, that constitutes a sizable army. Now figure that there are hundreds, perhaps millions more just like them in every town and every city in America. If you're thinking about it, our government is overwhelmed. They don't stand a chance. If our corrupt traitorous government continues to stand against us, and if patriots continue to stand against them, there is NO WAY the tyrants prevail.",11RhFcX3h4,10

Apparently congress works for whoever is blackmailing them from exposing disgusting acts and corruption. So essentially they’re working for the devil,11RhFcX3h4,10
This ^^^ I honestly think they sold their souls. At least a good amount of them. Look at their evil blood cooking parties or whatever that elite devil crap is,11RhFcX3h4,3
We need a leader though! The Will of the People is boiling but who will embrace that Will and bring it to bear?,11RhFcX3h4,7

the 20th is soon,11RhFcX3h4,6
problem is they cant win if it was fair ... thats why they dont want an audit or courts or evidence to be shown or examined in court,11RhFcX3h4,12
"The other problem is that the courts, judges, even SCOTUS was afraid of that opening that ugly can of worms...",11RhFcX3h4,2
then they are not doing their jobs thats the function of courts to be blind and apply the law not pick and choose whatever suits their political views or cower away in fear of being targeted by the woke mob,11RhFcX3h4,2
"it wasn't theirs to give or take away. They don't understand what happened yet. Come April 15th, if Trump is not president, they're going to realize they made a HUGE mistake.",11RhFcX3h4,4

I'm sure you can remain PM!,11RhFcX3h4,5

Dang. I thought I had it bad.,11RhFcX3h4,1

Commies don't know the significance of April 15th.,11RhFcX3h4,3
It’s tax day... and what they are saying is they aren’t going to pay them.,11RhFcX3h4,3
You calling me a commie?,11RhFcX3h4,2
Why do you think I called you a commie? Sensitive much? Or did I hit a nerve?,11RhFcX3h4,-3
You goddamn right I'm angry you called me a commie you fucking faggot. Thems fighting words you cuck,11RhFcX3h4,4

What happens April 15th?,11RhFcX3h4,1
PFFFTT.... Nothing will happen April 15th.,11RhFcX3h4,3

Bingo bango. Consent of the governed. Biden will NEVER be my president.,11RhFcX3h4,5
Taxes are due!,11RhFcX3h4,3
Most of then wouldn't be there if we had free and fair elections. We need to drain their bank accounts of ill gotten gains under the EO on aiding and abetting foreign election interference.,11RhFcX3h4,3
"Heck, trump didn't even call on pence to overturn the election like many people think. He wanted him just to send the electors back to the states and deal with them in the courts. Traitor pence couldn't even do that.",11RhFcX3h4,1

"Too many conservatives are disowning those who went to the Capitol. ""waaaahh the media is calling me a terrorist""",11RhFcX3h4,31

Who cares about media 'influencers'?,11RhFcX3h4,1
The same ones jump on the racism bandwagon each time a LE has a justified shooting.,11RhFcX3h4,1
The Washington Examiner called President Trump a tinpot strongman. The RINOs are terrified. They’re also calling for Marjorie Taylor Greene to be primaried. The Uniparty is deathly afraid.,11RhFcX3h4,24
Fantastic. We can build another wall on the northern border with all the bricks they’re shitting.,11RhFcX3h4,10
"Do it. My faggoty cucked country is crawling with communists, and probably still the Chinese. Add remote guns and infrared cameras.",11RhFcX3h4,5
We need a strong border built in Northern MN. Apparently Canada wants to train the Chinese military cold tactical fighting skills and MN is basically just a state constantly bending over with both cheeks spread waiting for it to happen,11RhFcX3h4,1
I am curious who the Rinos think will vote for them ? Unless their plan is to join in with the Democrats and officially adknowledging their Uniparty status for all to see ?,11RhFcX3h4,6
"They’ll rig the elections. If you’ve watch you can see the algorithm. 20-70%
39-59%
42-48.x%
48-52% or 49.x-51.x% is the winner. It’s the same shit. My math sucks, but basically, take loser and multiply by 1.2 or 1.8 and you get the winner.",11RhFcX3h4,6

Doesn't matter to them. GOP is confident they'll get 17 R senators to vote to impeach. They want Trump gone forever,11RhFcX3h4,10
They don't care about the 'party'. They care only that a populist outsider who exposes their agenda is gone. JFK paid the heaviest price.,11RhFcX3h4,11

"This he knows the real vote count, he knows how many people are fed up with our governments bullshit.",11RhFcX3h4,5
Worst dictator ever,11RhFcX3h4,118
Lol I kept standing around and would notice there’d be black folk around and I would second guess if they were BLM but they would have Trump merch and be protesting right along everyone else. It was awesome!,11RhFcX3h4,2
I unironically wished he was a dictator and a man who hated mass immigration like the media portrayed him to be.,11RhFcX3h4,5
If he had instigated anything people would have brought their guns.,11RhFcX3h4,97
"This is literally all he asked for, no more, no less. If the the intention was to go hot we could have all done that from home. Now we know where they all stand and weve witnessed a new day Boston Massacre.",11RhFcX3h4,54
"Patriots going hot would be a disaster yesterday. Every person willing and able to get off their ass and rock and roll would have been taken out in one fell swoop. It would have been a Pyrrhic victory. Going hot from home is the only way any type of asymmetric struggle is viable. An unorganized army of 200k holding down one city with pistols and a few long guns would get wrecked. Much more effective to have 40k 5 man teams dispersed throughout the whole country staging harass and hamper missions and slipping out. Makes it impossible for the larger force to utilize its might. This is how we beat the French, the British, the Germans, stalemated Korea, and how we got beat by VC and got stuck in the ME for 20 fucking years.",11RhFcX3h4,28
"If anyone knows how true this is, it should be our military members. This is the way modern wars are fought, long gone are the days of marching armies towards each other in an open field.",11RhFcX3h4,12
"The military members will be the thing that would decide the conflict. SOGs go in and train local partisans in guerrilla tactics and force the enemy to spread thin and cover too many sides. If millions of trump voters, throughout the country, are trained by thousands of operators it would probably be the largest partisan “army” in history. FYI I am not a military member but anybody can read books. US army small unit tactics handbook FTW.",11RhFcX3h4,9
That’s how we beat the British the first time. Wearing bright red coats and standing shoulder to shoulder they really were asking to get trounced. We need a return of the minute men! GEOTUS is speaking brb,11RhFcX3h4,4
"This is very similar to what ANTIFA does. At some point, ANTIFA will be our friends as they're anarchists. Same with Boogoolo Boys. You will either be pro-government or anti-government.",11RhFcX3h4,2
This has always been the way.,11RhFcX3h4,2
"That’s why I said it would a Pyrrhic victory. They would have won the battle but then what? Once they occupied Congress, they’d have been easily encircled by the military and everyone would have been killed or captured. I saw no long guns, but maybe there were a few. Then there’s a few folks with pistols, a few with plates, a few with radios. There was no chain of command and no leadership, limited comms, a bit of armor, and some small arms. Now, an ill equipped insurgent force can have a great deal of impact. But it can’t hold a building against the most powerful military in history.",11RhFcX3h4,1
"...the military can move to where it needs to be. Insurrection would have happened, and quickly put down.",11RhFcX3h4,1
(They did bring their guns. They just didn't use them.),11RhFcX3h4,21
They had to pass secret service pat down to enter the rally area. Whatever guns they brought were not on their persons.,11RhFcX3h4,9
"Oh, was the area around the capitol secured by secret service?",11RhFcX3h4,7
"I read somewhere that all people entering the rally had to go through security. As for the Capitol--I know for a fact that each member of Congress because of potential threats, has a personal security escort to walk them to their cars even. These are our lawmakers and there might be a person who is pissed off with the Congressman who voted this way or that...",11RhFcX3h4,5
"There was no security unless you got into the actual ellipse. 10,000+ easily could have been armed. I know at least one was ;)",11RhFcX3h4,12
"I didn't, this isn't true",11RhFcX3h4,2
I feel like you’re missing the point,11RhFcX3h4,3
I meant they would have brought them and used them.,11RhFcX3h4,3
They could've. But they didn't. Why? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT LOSING.,11RhFcX3h4,10
This place was lighting up with “I have my gun ready. Trump told us to be there”. You’re making excuses now.,11RhFcX3h4,1
If Trump has said PEOPLE. THAT IS YOUR HOUSE. TAKE IT BACK. FILL THE SEATS. That place wouldn't have lasted 10 minutes.,11RhFcX3h4,88
Damn right! Awomen No blas,11RhFcX3h4,14
"I have never seen a more peaceful... I mean violent... Overtaking of a government building in my entire life. Not a single opposition was even hurt.

"All Trump asked for was the truth to be revealed. Yet the rats in Congress managed to get away with the evidence of their crimes. If Trump really was the dictator the left is trying to paint him as, all of Congress would have their heads on pikes and the country better for it.",11RhFcX3h4,55
DC would be a smoldering pit if we were as violent as they say we are.,11RhFcX3h4,38
"This was but the giant flexing his pinky toe after a long slumber. The left knows this. They saw all those irate fathers and mothers. They know trump kept them on the chain. They know ashlei is a martyr now. Everyone sees their daughter the mother their sister their friend their wife. I promise you they are in full panic mode right now because their agenda just got shat on. They were hoping to drop the boot on our necks. Now they’re scared what will happen the next time we come back. Look at them call in six states worth of national guard. Any historian will tell you this is just the start of a huge backlash. The right has become a beast unto itself and it is one who demands recompense in blood. A war time trump is coming, and when he ascends the throne, there will be screams for mercy and civility, but there will be none found.",11RhFcX3h4,35
"They deserve no mercy - Democrats, RINOS, journalists.",11RhFcX3h4,11
Genuinely curious what exactly you are getting at here. This reads like overly poetic Trump fan fiction.,11RhFcX3h4,0

"Honestly kinda hilarious that patriots looked clueless as to what to do when they got in there. Some of them were kinda walking around taking pictures and being like, ""wow this is cool"" 😂. Compare that to what ANTIFA/BLM did last year. Complete and total opposite. Yet these politicians want to act like it was the absolute WORST thing to happen to our country. I think it's safe to say that patriots are decent folks with a whole lot of patience. But that patience will not last forever.",11RhFcX3h4,31
The respected the velvet ropes. They took selfies with cops. The other entrance was different...,11RhFcX3h4,4
"I mean, once they were inside the only thing they could have done was commit wanton destruction. But since that wasn't what they came there to do, all they could manage was some self guided tours and a few minor shenanigans. Granted, there was a lot of scuffling with capitol police, but that was only because they stood in the way. It is perfectly clear that, despite the police presence, the ""intruders"" had full control of the place.",11RhFcX3h4,2
"If Trump said the word, every living creature in DC besides the patriots would be dead.",11RhFcX3h4,21
That one guy who murdered Ashli would have ran out of ammo unloading on patriots and they would've done whatever they wanted.,11RhFcX3h4,20
The truth is almost every patriot was strapped. I spoke to many that were. Made me shed a tear of joy and we didn’t kill a single person. Moral high ground!,11RhFcX3h4,19
The discipline of that crowd was amazing,11RhFcX3h4,12
"Yes, this is perhaps the 2nd most impressive thing about the whole affair, 2nd only to forcing congress to flee while it was in session. Honestly, I have to give kudos to both patriots and capitol police for remaining professional. This is going to win me a lot of downvotes with the anti-blue crowd here but I honestly can't fault the police for doing their jobs. I would personally prefer that police just fuck off and leave but that obviously wasn't going to happen. There was little police could do under the circumstances other than give ground and they knew it. They were there to maintain order and patriots were committed to keeping order, but still bound and determined to advance until they had taken every inch of that place. To see patriots and police standing side by side for no other reason than both were determined to be there is honestly uplifting somehow. Sure, they were yelling and screaming and cussing at each other and telling each other to back off, but they respected each other's presence. It would have been so easy for any one of them, patriot or police, to just start shooting. Unfortunately, someone did that day. And may God have mercy on that sonofabitch's soul because America won't.",11RhFcX3h4,5
there was no imminent threat to life. cops should not have shot that girl.,11RhFcX3h4,3
"It is unclear who shot that woman. Sadly, congress and their media lapdogs will want to memory hole her so unless someone else really insists on an investigation, we might never know who shot her or why.",11RhFcX3h4,1
"There's clear video of which person shot her. The other police and security staff who were in the room already know who it was. We might never know, but the information is somewhere. This is the original video from the guy who recorded, he is a BLM leader. Why was he there filming it? https://twitter.com/thejaydenxander/status/1347056697899163648",11RhFcX3h4,1
Well I mean they blamed Trump when that patriot prayer member was hunted and gunned down in cold blood so its not like they let facts get in the way of their narrative,11RhFcX3h4,15
All of conservative media is calling normal blue collar Americans terrorists because they were walked into the Capitol building accompanied by police.,11RhFcX3h4,13
"My family had Fox on and they had some faggot calling them terrorists and told them to fucking turn that shit off. Such a disgraceful network. I’m not religious, but man I hope Hell’s 9th circle is ready to receive all of these bastards when they die.",11RhFcX3h4,11
"If trump had said 'civil war, go' the country would be on fire in a very real way",11RhFcX3h4,12
More like Trump would be president and those rats wouldn't have their heads still attached to them.,11RhFcX3h4,11
Trump should incite a riot.,11RhFcX3h4,10
The nice and decent Americans aren't very good at riots.,11RhFcX3h4,11

"I bet we would be good at deposing frauds and reinstituting Constitutional government, if we ever had to.",11RhFcX3h4,4
"We would be good and extremely effective but we would be ungainly, undisciplined and shoddy. Expect a lot of missed shots and collateral damage if the average citizen gets involved. A lot of people would simply use the chaos to wreak havoc for funsies. I say we give the military a chance to have a crack at dealing with this insurrection by our government before we do, eh?",11RhFcX3h4,1
"I could be wrong, but I don't believe Trump will fix this using the military. I think he believes the USA can survive a Biden presidency and find another way to fix the fraud long term. He loves America and tries to determine what is best and healthiest for it. I pray that he is making the right call(s) on all of this.",11RhFcX3h4,0
"I can't imagine, if Trump didn't want there to be displays of civil disobedience, that he would have sent an open invitation to millions of pissed off supporters so tens of thousands of them could show up in DC on the 6th, exactly when the fraudulent vote to certify a fraudulent election would be taking place, and then end his rally by directing the aforementioned pissed off supporters to the US capitol building specifically to ""give congress the moral courage to do the right thing"" and somehow expect some of the aforementioned pissed off supporters not to try to storm said US capitol building. Come on. If Trump was ready to direct American protesters to drive congress out of their chambers, then he's ready to use the military option. The only question is whether or not the military is with him.",11RhFcX3h4,1
"Totally agree with this except Trump doesn't just have 100s of thousands of followers. He was well over 80 million, and that is in the US alone. MAGAMAGAMAGA USUSUS",11RhFcX3h4,10
75 or 80 million--people who lost their voice because of theft. You betcha we're feeling angry. Trump's anger is in part due to how hard he worked to secure that landslide.,11RhFcX3h4,7
"THERE WILL BE AN ENDLESS SEA TO DESTROY THEM.... A SEA OF PATRIOTS, THAT IS.",11RhFcX3h4,4
"Agreed. Trump never called for violence or destruction. These are adults who did things on their own. Congress is lucky Trump did not hypothetically say ""go in... no survivors."" Trump is peaceful. He didn't start wars. He seeks to end violence legally. He just wants the world to stop killing itself.",11RhFcX3h4,10
The capitol building would be a smoldering pile of brick and ash too. It was entirely peaceful... not like they understand that word.,11RhFcX3h4,9
hannity is going on about how the people that stormed the capitol were not the 99% of trump supporters. I KID YOU NOT!,11RhFcX3h4,5
The protesters insurrectionists according to CNN were happily taking selfies WITH the capitol police and were invited inside by the capitol police. They were so dangerous they were chanting “ACAF”,11RhFcX3h4,5
What is “ACAF”,11RhFcX3h4,1
This is why impeachment is being suggested. I will return if the elected president asks. I will bring every constitutional right i have.👍🇺🇲,11RhFcX3h4,5
"Some people who were there called in to Rush today. Said antifa did most of this, and supporters were calmly walking through the building after.",11RhFcX3h4,4
Mentioned on someone's live feed- they were taking something out of Nancy's office. Some one on our side or their side- ordered someone to blend in and take it. I am sure they had a map and a team to distract.,11RhFcX3h4,4
Trump would never do that. He loves the American people too much to lose even one of us. Including the retards.,11RhFcX3h4,4

"He also would not have played “My Way” after his speech, as we were leaving the ellipse.",11RhFcX3h4,4
Telling that he presumed the worst from Congress.,11RhFcX3h4,1
Looking like we need to drop the polite protest shit,11RhFcX3h4,4
If Trump called for a revolt there would have been an actual revolution. That’s why George Washington is the single greatest figure in American history. Many of us are willing. We just need our leaders.,11RhFcX3h4,3

two dozen? we had at least 1000 patriots inside.,11RhFcX3h4,2
Antifa and BLM burned a building with people inside of it and burned down a fucking Wendy's. This level of gaslighting from the media and vile politicians is as close to satanism as I've ever seen in my life.,11RhFcX3h4,2
"Also he would have had to say to do it, he never said such a thing. The media is spinning as always.",11RhFcX3h4,2
"Well, asking millions of your followers to be at one place at one time, then asking them all to march down to a building filled with people you hate… I don’t want to be intellectually dishonest here. I’m not saying he incited a riot, but if Barack Obama had done that you people would say that he did.",11RhFcX3h4,2
"""the only reason our protest fizzled into nothing was because Trump told us to"" alright",11RhFcX3h4,-1
And we should be,11RhFcX3h4,2
"As I told a few people at the protest itself, while discussing the obvious Antifa agitators: if Trump told me to storm the Capitol, I would. But he didn't.",11RhFcX3h4,2
Trump's children have been silent too. I'm very worried,11RhAsStqz,166
"Me too, when was Trumps last post, is he on anything different from FB and twitter? just want to know he and is family are okay?",11RhAsStqz,52
he got 24 hour fb ban and 12 hour twitter ban,11RhAsStqz,57
Believe he's suspended on Instagram too.,11RhAsStqz,15
"Not that I necessarily like him very much, but Wood on Parler says that Trump is in Abilene TX. He says that the President is monitoring the vote and the secretary of defense is waiting for the traitors to finish their crime, suggesting that there is another reason why there are soldiers there...",11RhAsStqz,29
I would be so happy if that was true.,11RhAsStqz,3
"Yeah I saw that. I'd like to believe that true. Yeah, I'd like to...",11RhAsStqz,3
He's been silent,11RhAsStqz,17
Now like the self defeating cunts they are the entire republican party will denounce there own constituency for being passionate The gop doesnt eant anything more than a mildly motivated base JUST motivated enough to donate but not enough to fight for change,11RhAsStqz,41
Republicans are done after this.,11RhAsStqz,38
Time to tear it down and start over.,11RhAsStqz,26
I'm not voting for them ever again. Looks like I'll be voting for myself or some fun 3rd party candidates like Constitution Party,11RhAsStqz,25
Never voting for them again. I dont care sbout tax cuts for the rich ir deregilating banks And thats all they have to offerr,11RhAsStqz,15
"Nah, I think republicans will be fine. Dumbshits will still vote for them because ""they're better than blue"". The only way any of them will learn is to ONLY vote maga/pede candidates. If they've proven themselves and have a history of it, even if it means letting democrats win until someone is worthy. Otherwise it'll just be the same old, rino gaining power and being majority because ""cant let the democrats win"". The republican party needs to be extinguished, and rebuilt. And if that means letting the other side win until then, then so be it.",11RhAsStqz,8
Jenna Ellis agrees with you on her Twitter.,11RhAsStqz,4
Matt Gaetz just gave a damned good speech,11RhAsStqz,24
That last line. Nailed it.,11RhAsStqz,1
the dude above you just said he got a 12 hour twitter ban,11RhAsStqz,7
"Yes he did, but he and his children have been silent on all platforms",11RhAsStqz,7
keep in mind that it has been a very big day,11RhAsStqz,7
"I would hope that means they are initiating plan impale pelosi and mitch on the steeple of liberty hall. Yes, it will be more work getting them to philly, but i think it's worth the photo-op",11RhAsStqz,3
Charlie Kirk said 9:00 still haven’t heard anything.,11RhAsStqz,4
Anyone actually seen him and/or family since the 6th?,11RhAsStqz,1
"He's able to make statements on
https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/statement-from-president-donald-j.-trump-152020/
but his last statement there was Jan 5th.",11RhAsStqz,6
"and no updates on the Trump app, either 😟",11RhAsStqz,3
The President has beened banned on twitter,11RhAsStqz,2
Calm before the storm. President Trump is in Abilene TX.,11RhAsStqz,3
"Rumors are half his cabinet are asking him to resign tomorrow, or they will.",11RhAsStqz,-8
"cool, let them resign. For names to add to the list.",11RhAsStqz,35
"""Your terms are acceptable. Buh Bye"".",11RhAsStqz,25
"""Good, GTFO. You've all been worthless.""",11RhAsStqz,13
"good. i hope they ALL resign so we can add them to the ""shit"" pile, so we know who to ignore, on top of all the other senators, congressman, governors and mayors",11RhAsStqz,7
he resigns the presidency he is basically accepting being imprisoned for the rest of his life.,11RhAsStqz,3
"AJ built his own service. Still big tech messes with his stuff but he has more autonomy. Just yesterday I had a pede telling me facebook and social media is good, it lets them keep in touch with people. As if keeping in touch with people actually requires selling yourself out to the technocrats. Wake up folks. Leave social media immediately. Build new communities on decentralized platforms. I could tell you which ones to use, but you should instead figure it out yourself. Teach yourself to fish this time so you are not caught in someone else's net.",11RhAsStqz,10
Trump can still be found on Gab https://gab.com/REALDONALDTRUMP,11RhAsStqz,7
"that account is just a retweet bot, not the actual president.",11RhAsStqz,26
How come it's tweeting if he's suspended from tweeting,11RhAsStqz,-1
You'd think he would say something.,11RhAsStqz,1
eh Alex Jones has his own website and hasn't said anything on it yet,11RhAsStqz,1
avn has their entire own network you nitwit,11RhAsStqz,1
"Bannon had his WarRoom show. He was actually very level headed. Said that the extra time from the delay gives the states time to decertify, which is good for us.",11RhAsStqz,33
Except they are doing it tonight.,11RhAsStqz,66
Not happening. The election is being certified as we speak,11RhAsStqz,58
The actual plan for us is death or communism,11RhAsStqz,36
"I'll choose death for them, thanks.",11RhAsStqz,-2
"As a Canadian, I'd gladly trade places. We are 10 years ahead of the cuckery of the US and it isn't getting better",11RhAsStqz,5
slab of beef (no Hillary) is like $50 there,11RhAsStqz,4
"LOL no, fuck off you beta faggot. They're openly talking about starving Americans to death you retard, you know, just like the Bolsheviks did last time they gained complete control of a country.",11RhAsStqz,1
"Canada isn’t communist, stupid. Fuck off to china.",11RhAsStqz,1
There is ..the return of Christ...aaaaafter the one world government and mandatory covid passes to be able to buy or sell. Good news.....the antichrist only gets there and a half years,11RhAsStqz,12
Fuck it. Let our demise begin. Just go out fighting.,11RhAsStqz,5
"Anti-christ gets 3 1/2 years, then the beast & mark of the beast get 3 1/2 years, by my understanding.",11RhAsStqz,2
The events of today were the plan. Trump crammed one last gigantic middle finger up the ass of the political establishment that never gave him a chance. I am grateful to have been part of it.,11RhAsStqz,11
"eh....that wasn't really ""the plan"". but ok...",11RhAsStqz,3
"Maybe not the plan, but that’s what happened. And it’s all that’s going to happen. Trump’s presidency is finished.",11RhAsStqz,1
"Trust the plan, bubble!",11RhAsStqz,2
"Is the house meeting, I can't find anything on the house reconvening?",11RhAsStqz,4
When are we turning on bannon?,11RhAsStqz,2
"I hope most of you have realized, since early November, this was always the way it was going to go. Cheating or not, no judge or politician has the balls to go against the propaganda machine. If Biden were a Republican, maybe... (but still doubtful).",11RhAsStqz,43
"Oh, if Biden were a republican they'd certainly reverse the fraud. Msm would encourage it and they wouldn't have repercussions",11RhAsStqz,12
"Woah, no, the media will 100% support a Republican if they agree with their values. Like, they were so behind Bush when he was challenging an election.",11RhAsStqz,4
"The hate for Bush in 2006/2007 was off the charts. Fast forward a decade later [same group] “Aww, he gave Michelle Obama a piece of gum.”",11RhAsStqz,6
Dog I suggest you turn on cspan and watch them certifying the election right now. Bannon is a dunce,11RhAsStqz,26
Storming of the Capitol was a psyop and uninformed patriots got caught up in the Antifa lead frenzy. The controllers knew this would happen and congress will use this a pressure to persuade objectors to the votes to not object and the media will use it to vilify trump and ultimately destroy the patriots in the coming months and years. It's unfortunate that all true patriots did not understand the psyop and failed to to not enter the building.,11RhAsStqz,3
disagree. it was not. it was people fed the fuck up at our loser government that is a uniparty that shits on us. fuck em all.,11RhAsStqz,6
"Yeah, just like those foolish patriots fell for that Boston Tea Party psyop. /s",11RhAsStqz,4
"fuck ""the courts"". i dont give a shit what a judge says anymore.",11RhAsStqz,5
"That's probably one of the weakest excuses that I've ever heard in my entire life. Hurr durr, I no longer care about election integrity because a handful of unarmed citizens ""breached"" public property.",11RhAsStqz,47
"She is parroting the Supreme Court. Hurr durr, there will be riots if we take the Texas case.",11RhAsStqz,5
Don't really care if it had a chance. Her reasoning is stupid and obviously a lie.,11RhAsStqz,4
"So, she was a treasonous bitch all along? she just lied to get votes.",11RhAsStqz,40
I seem to recall an accusation she had a hand in paying off Brian Kemp's debts related to a John Deere business venture. Thought it was in the millions.,11RhAsStqz,5
Don't blame it on women - she's a snake like all other RINOs and this one just happens to be a woman. We heard plenty of disgraceful men today.,11RhAsStqz,9
With what? Votes?,11RhAsStqz,2
We can come up with something more creative.,11RhAsStqz,1
"The only cunt here is you. The bulk of congress is men. Those hundreds of men have fucked ALL of us over. But being a smooth brained misogynist as you are- likely the only knowledge of women you have is your hand and your vivid imagination. Where were you today, limpdick? At home raging behind your keyboard like the fat, unwanted neckbeard you are? Many female patriots were in DC with more balls than you apparently have. Good luck with life, limpdick!",11RhAsStqz,0
"The storming of the building was done deliberate by alphabet agents. It was designed to make it worse from the start. They somehow clean everything up and instantly reconvene in one night? If it were a real threat they'd delay this shit for a week or more to sweep the area, check for bombs or other threats, shuttle all the faggot politicians home, etc then reconvene. Not redo it right away.",11RhAsStqz,13
100% right. This was an op. That fucking faggot horned man.,11RhAsStqz,5
"Yes, all 100,000 people were federal agents. Total psyop guys, let's go back to trusting the plan and begging for MSM optics.",11RhAsStqz,3
If that’s all it takes we didn’t want them anyway,11RhAsStqz,9
"Bull, Bannon talks big thats all.",11RhAsStqz,6
Alex Jones is livestreaming on banned.video with Owen.,11RhAsStqz,29
They went all day long on Infowars. They were on-scene and it was the best coverage I found. Up-to-date with eye witnesses and other accounts. Even they need a break.,11RhAsStqz,10
No hes not,11RhAsStqz,-5
Yes he is,11RhAsStqz,4
I don’t see the feed,11RhAsStqz,-1
"https://banned.video/channel/war-room-with-owen-shroyer looks like they removed the watch live button from the header, probably way too much traffic to handle. the feed is glitching",11RhAsStqz,6
"Maybe so. They had an awesome feed earlier, the best I know of. Now I’m concerned, where is everyone? Alex, POTUS..",11RhAsStqz,7
"Blacklisted, black bagged, could be either.",11RhAsStqz,1
"I'm curious where Bannon goes from here, since Bart Starr fumbled the hand off to Emerson Boozer for the famed Green Bay Packers power sweep. It's a long outdated system. Kinda like thinking if we put enough pressure on our reps that this would get kicked back to the legislators and all would be fine.",11RhAsStqz,14
Continue associating with that exiled shady chinese billionaire,11RhAsStqz,-3
Trump has been silenced on Twitter. Alex was at the march today and both him and Banon had livestreams but now they're quiet.,11RhAsStqz,14
"Alex put a new video on banned dot video, sort by new. They're trying the 25th amendment again...",11RhAsStqz,8
Alex is a patriot and he is doing everything he can to fix this. He doesn't have access to any other platform than his own. You will see.,11RhAsStqz,1
I'm so fucking sick of this gaslighting.,11RhAsStqz,256
More sick of the people who drink it up. Fuggin sheep.,11RhAsStqz,44
"It makes me so sad. It's like you can't get through to them, they ONLY trust CNN, NYT, WaPo, etc",11RhAsStqz,8
I can't even watch politicians speak anymore it makes me sick to my stomach,11RhAsStqz,17
they are all shitbags. listen to NOTHING they say,11RhAsStqz,4
"preach brother, they are all experts in the trade of deceit.",11RhAsStqz,3
Trust the plan. We all die and go to Heaven.,11RhAsStqz,10
nope some of us are definitely goin to hell,11RhAsStqz,7
Because this movement is real not paid. That is why you are hated. Never forgot that.,11RhAsStqz,225
Exactly. If the left wing riots that happened all summer were authentic and unwanted the reaction by the government and media would have been much different. Those were government and corporate endorsed riots. You know a protest is real by the reaction of the media and government.,11RhAsStqz,68
If you buy the false flag theory it explains why protesters so easily enter the capitol for the optics of trump terrorist and now they got the footage they are using oppressive force to ensure the curfew.,11RhAsStqz,30
"Compare to the army outside Kate Browns fortress a week or so ago. That place was fort knox, but the Capital (expecting them) lets them Walk in?! I’ve seen way too much evidence this is antifa like the pole through salems Capitol. The speeches by congress as they arrived on time was the clincher.",11RhAsStqz,7
the pole through salems Capitol wut,11RhAsStqz,2
"https://www.businessinsider.com/far-right-protestors-storm-oregon-state-capitol-building-2020-12?op=1 With photo. Commie rag but you get the point. Turned into a “stormed the building” moment.

Note the backwards hat and lack of blood stains https://i.maga.host/6xCyK4M.png
https://i.maga.host/3Bi2IKl.png",11RhAsStqz,1
"There was a protest at Oregon Capitol in Salem. People tried to get into a covid locked legislative session and got pepperballed in the face (a veteran with service dog and a woman) the elected laughed at the protestors from the windows above. They were protesting around the building. Suddenly random guy runs a metal pole into a side door at the Capitol (the first property damage occurrence.) after that it the dynamic changed so hard they shut it down. The following protest we watched the governors black riot militia let antifa ,armed, into the protest, confirming the collision. They use antifa to change the native so they can claim ask the things projected on us that they want to. When one runs in it encourages a few angry patriots to go with as cover.",11RhAsStqz,1
"the pole through salems Capitol
wut",11RhAsStqz,1
"It's not a ""protest"" if larger swaths of the government agree. Occupy wallstreet? That was an actual protest. The government actually disagreed with them across the board.",11RhAsStqz,3
And it got co-opted rather quickly to have no actual effect. I’d like to think we’re built different.,11RhAsStqz,1
It is actually one of the worst days in modern history because they have just resumed the electoral certification & we are about to lose any hope we had left of fair & just elections moving forward.,11RhAsStqz,170
Its the worst day because America died. We will soon be slaves whose only purpose is to be a tax value commodity to some random globalist commie elite excel spreadsheet. We arent even human.,11RhAsStqz,82
Have fun while you have a little bit of freedom left.,11RhAsStqz,15
"What freedom? We can't go to a movie, ball gam, bar or even grandma's house. It will never end with Chinacrats in control. Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast except the shotgun is empty. Freedom is gone. America is dead.",11RhAsStqz,39
The chinacrats are not that powerful. They’re third rate tyrants. Biden and Harris aren’t exactly sharp. Freedom isn’t gone. We have the Supreme Court. Today was awful but it’s not over. Not even close.,11RhAsStqz,-1
We have the Supreme Court. We do ?,11RhAsStqz,10
"Kavanugh, Gorsuch, Barett, Thomas and Alito are all solid patriots. This wasn’t their election to overturn. It was the republicans in congress that let us down.",11RhAsStqz,-4
They already got rid of that.,11RhAsStqz,9
Have you ever considered that it's been that way for several decades already and people are only now to the point where they're realizing it?,11RhAsStqz,9
The captcha proved our humanity 🐸. America only dies if leaders and fighters give up and cuck out. We need more local leaders folks.,11RhAsStqz,8
"When the people give up, the swamp wins. We know how much we can change for election integrity.",11RhAsStqz,3
"Dang, the way you're black-pilling, it sounds like you got nothing left to lose at this point except for your ammo stockpile.",11RhAsStqz,1
We just got people murdered today and the chinese puppet biden is getting certified. Wtf are you on about??,11RhAsStqz,16
"At this point, pretty much my only hope is Jesus. Seeing high profile people like Josh Hawley say every person who stormed the capital should be persecuted to the fullest extend of the law is the equivalent of saying every Jew should just ""obey the law"" in Germany from 1933 and after.",11RhAsStqz,42
"In case you have any doubt, here is his twitter feed",11RhAsStqz,4
"Okay, so what do you propose we do in the meantime, before we die i.e. the rest of our lives? Die on our knees like the Christians outside of western nations?",11RhAsStqz,0

"let me explain this to ya. i am a jew. I see the writing on the wall and im about to get citizenship in israel and renounce my US citizenship forever. Im gonna try to get the fuck out of here as fast as possible, specifically so I dont have to relive what my grandparents did and probably not escape this time. so yes. I do compare it to that personally. well its more like a combo strike of that mixed with the USSR in some fucky way.... probably better to describe it like china. so honestly yes. i do see it that way. and im fucking out now and i wont even return here for a visit if i make it away. just gonna leave everything behind me and hope i dont die homeless across the sea.",11RhAsStqz,3
"Maybe you can live near Pollard or Bibi. “How dare you talk about divided loyalty!” “I renounce US citizenship and claim my Israeli status. Hey you Americans who thought I was on your side, no hard feelings.

Thank you. Please convince those around you to do likewise. Shalom.,11RhAsStqz,1
Living up to that username. So brave!,11RhAsStqz,1
hope keeps you complacent,11RhAsStqz,-2
Hope gives you a reason to actually do anything. Despair makes you complacent.,11RhAsStqz,11
"Take the positive: Senators were afraid of a couple dozen unarmed young people holding gavels. That's a sign of severe weakness, not strength. When the leadership fears the people, the system balances. If the people give up and leave politics entirely, leadership wins and the swamp continues. Now imagine beating them at their own game, as a populist. Now, you're dangerous to the establishment. Trump was just too early and didn't have enough support, a lone wolf doesn't survive long in the swamp.",11RhAsStqz,4
They let you in so they could make you out to be terrorists. They hid in fear for the photo shoot.,11RhAsStqz,7
"Ignore them. They're all trying to cope with the fact we're now all fucked. Look forward to having 5G masts in every US city and town, we're now the newest province of China",11RhAsStqz,13
We basically have been since Harry Reid sold all our manufacturing out to China.,11RhAsStqz,3
Can you explain the 5G to me? I don't understand how it fits into their evil agendas. Are they trying to fry our brains now too?,11RhAsStqz,1
we? I didn’t pull the trigger. Did you?,11RhAsStqz,6
WE as in OUR PEOPLE GOT MURDERED. Do you know English?!,11RhAsStqz,0

When has Patriot blood ever been spilled on the Capitol floor? Has it ever happened? That's the sign pedes.,11RhAsStqz,46
Remember that girl and take her memory back to the states. That's where all of this corruption originates.,11RhAsStqz,8
It's the day the President was silenced too. President Trump sure did make today a statement day. Do we build upon it or admit defeat and follow the orders of traitors in Government and if we disobey our social credit goes down and we lose benefits.,11RhAsStqz,15
Why couldn’t they just let us have 8 years and then peacefully lull us into this shit? They just HAD to get greedy,11RhAsStqz,9
They couldn’t survive 8 years. This is desperation on parade.,11RhAsStqz,6
Are you implying we lost fairly?,11RhAsStqz,1
"For the 10 millionth time, those weren’t all Trump cases. They only filed like 3",11RhAsStqz,1
"It is the worst day... but not because of what the media says, but it’s the day we lost the republic. In my heart of hearts, when President Trump goes to sleep tonight, I hope he still believes it wasn’t all for nothing. He inspired millions of us and still does. He is and always will be the best President of my lifetime.",11RhAsStqz,107
That makes me sad.... The last president,11RhAsStqz,37
"And conveniently, the media is trying to make today his legacy, cement him as ""the worst president of all time""",11RhAsStqz,16
JFK cheated to get in though,11RhAsStqz,3

“World War 2 is the only thing that has ever happened in history”,11RhAsStqz,4
Interesting choice for Antifa to hit. The Linn wood retweeting patriot. They hate beauty and Truth. No one mentioned her when the Senate made their 6 pm appointment. Makes me sick to watch them bad mouth patriots. Such a set up,11RhAsStqz,3
"No, sir. It's the day you knew the republic was lost. It was lost long ago.",11RhAsStqz,10
"Inspiration is useless to slaves. Unless he uses the powers we invested into him, he will go down as the president who ended the republic. Some legacy.",11RhAsStqz,2
This is why optics are pointless. They do this to us every single time. A Trump supporter could accidentally miss the garbage can and CNN would be telling the world the planet just got 2 degrees permanently hotter via global warming. Why do we still care? How can people still scream optics here? I'd rather be called every word possible then fall under communism.,11RhAsStqz,100
"100%, you've always made good posts here I remember a number of years ago the Youtube HQ got shot up by some deranged Iranian girl who thought that her channel was being suppressed because she was Iranian.

"Because when 330 million people are being told one thing by the media, and only 1 million are wise enough to have their eyes open, what the 330 million believe is the only thing that matters. We've lost. We're the losers now.",11RhAsStqz,-1
Nah it’s not that simple. Look at how much the media hated Trump in 2016 and he still won. Passion wins,11RhAsStqz,7
He won because his number of supporters > Hilary's number of supporters. Trump made no alliances and now look where we are,11RhAsStqz,-4
"Problem is, who do you even make alliances with in our government as an outsider? Seemingly every part is corrupt as hell.",11RhAsStqz,4
"You use the powers of the president as well as decades of deal making to strong arm the support you need and remove the traitors in your midst. Trump did none of that, and this is where it's gotten us.",11RhAsStqz,-4
Lol I know right? Next presidential aide right here 🙋‍♀️,11RhAsStqz,-1
Hillary was also arrogant enough to push her media sycophants to hype up Trump coverage. He’s a master marketer but he got like $3B in free advertising. The Dems were not going to make that mistake and underestimate him that badly again.,11RhAsStqz,1
"It's truly remarkable. There was a very diverse crowd. Women, children, elderly. It was people who were there because they believed in freedom and the constitution. They came out to show support for a men who they felt supported them. They were labeled rioters, mobsters, terrorists by everyone except those around them. May God help us all.",11RhAsStqz,72
"Ok? You seeing white men in clips somehow delegitimizes the thousands of men, women, and children from around the world that came to DC with various backgrounds? Use your brain man.",11RhAsStqz,4

We need mods to tell us if this is legal or illegal speech,11RhAsStqz,36
CNN says that only they can legally view this meme.,11RhAsStqz,10
The admins here are the only reason we have ANY place on the Internet to speak. Literally every other platform already banned us. Maybe lose the attitude.,11RhAsStqz,4
"What has 4chan or 8chan actually accomplished over the past decade other than get the ""ok"" symbol labeled as white supremacy?",11RhAsStqz,1
"Am I the only one that thinks there wasn't really any violence today? Yes, people pushed back and sometimes fought with the police. No counter protesters, or random civilians were hurt or killed. In fact, the only murder was committed by the government.",11RhAsStqz,34
"you are not. it doesn't matter. In politics its not about truth, its about power. Currently, they have it, and were able to use today's events to get more. Trump fucked up. Either he did not consider how the rally he called was going to be used against him. Or he trusted the wrong man (Pence), again. The events that happened today and their outcomes became inevitable when he put out the call for this rally while not having a solid plan on how to score the win. There was no scenario where an angry crowd of MAGA people sees Pence's statement and doesn't rush the Capitol Building. And there was no scenario in which a bunch of unprepared and disorganized people that showed up for a rally, become anything other than an easily manageable mob.",11RhAsStqz,6
"I disagree, the reason they gain any ""power"" over this, is because Republicans completely cucked out to democrats and literally do whatever they and their media handlers demand of them. The ultimate problem is that the President does not have the Constitutional power to fight this on his own, and the uniparty doesn't care for anyone outside their bubble.",11RhAsStqz,3
Are there still many people out in DC? early enough to where antifa groups still can come out unfortunately,11RhAsStqz,5
"Good point. With all the people, you'd expect more carnage, but only 1 person died. Still one too many, but it could have been worse.",11RhAsStqz,4
One person died... by the police. Literally nobody started violence in the actual movement.,11RhAsStqz,2
I believe a man was pepper sprayed in the face and suffered a heart attack. Word on the street is he died,11RhAsStqz,2
Try harder dude,11RhAsStqz,2
Well yeah that’s obvious,11RhAsStqz,1
The facts don't matter anymore.,11RhAsStqz,1
SET UP! PLANNED!,11RhAsStqz,32
"They all had speeches written, this was all planned.
Trump has been stabbed on all sides.",11RhAsStqz,31
"""Et tu, Pence?""",11RhAsStqz,16
how many times did Kushner stab him?,11RhAsStqz,1
Death to all commies and traitors. I'm done with this double standard.,11RhAsStqz,30
"It's nasty isn't it? They go months without shooting Antifa, who actually ARE violent and destorying properties with fire. But look at how quick they are to shoot us.",11RhAsStqz,26
"I can't help but think about Portland and how they were trying to block (cement?) the doors of the police precinct and kill police inside. Or when they actually used all kinds of weapons against the police. No one gets shot when they try to kill police, but this unarmed female veteran gets killed - it's clear she wasn't trying to attack police. She had plenty of opportunities in the hallways she was previously in.",11RhAsStqz,7
Not sure why anyone is surprised. They were so excited for this to happen and to crack down on Trump supporters.,11RhAsStqz,2
"When my town gets burned down it's a peaceful protest. When they need to put a plastic bag over their heads and have a fake staged evacuation suddenly it's ""violence""",11RhAsStqz,26
I just want to know that Trump is alive :/,11RhAsStqz,21
"Thank you for the practical look! He was so sad and upset in the last video, then his account got locked and stuff so i’ve been concerned. I was at the gathering but too far away to hear the speeches, so I was excited at the capitol too.",11RhAsStqz,2
"Laughing at all the crybabies who are saying ""Unfollow me if you support Trump"" when their arguments get defeated by the facts and their hypocrisy is exposed.",11RhAsStqz,20
"Because they cannot proceed to govern unless they convince those governed that nothing abnormal happened in the election. Before tomorrow I bet I will believe the video from Georgia was perfectly normal, and that it's normal for the counting to go on for days in ever smaller increments.",11RhAsStqz,3
I told my Mom that this is what actual conservatives have to do do get a single politician on either side to pay attention to them and maybe stop shipping jobs overseas.,11RhAsStqz,3
"The second image interrupted the showmanship in the senate/house. THERE WERE CAMERAS ON THEM, THEIR MAKE UP WAS PERFECT, THEY HAD THE SCRIPTS READY! It made them squirm and that was the real crime.",11RhAsStqz,19
My thought exactly ...where is the President????,11RhAsStqz,19
Probably arrested for inciting a riot,11RhAsStqz,4
And how did he somehow incite a riot while also saying “be peaceful” and to “go home”? Weird huh,11RhAsStqz,2
"No, idk, I think the charge could stick",11RhAsStqz,1
"The difference, they achieved their goal through violence.
We lost our goal because they expected we wouldn't use violence, and they were right",11RhAsStqz,19
This was just the shot across the bow. From now on they start taking it below the waterline.,11RhAsStqz,12
"They had a false flag in there. WE weren't going to storm in, they had antifa LARPers leading the charge dressed as pedes. And now the violence they caused, blamed on us, is used (by Loeffler ?) as the excuse for not objecting to certification. Originally she said she was going to object (must have been lying about her intention to object, from the start), but changed her mind about objecting because of the violence. Bullshit. If she actually thought the election was stolen, she would continue to object. The storming and the stealing are two different issues. I guess the DS murdering Kemp's daughter's boyfriend caused her to rethink her life choices.",11RhAsStqz,5
"We already knew she was swamp so I'm not surprised, I thought that bigot Warnock won",11RhAsStqz,1
IDK is she the outgoing incumbent?,11RhAsStqz,1
"I guess so, I lived in Georgia for 8 years and never heard of her or warnock. I know who ossoff is, nobody liked him last time he ran either",11RhAsStqz,1
It wasnt antifa it was insufferable Q tards.,11RhAsStqz,0
"Nah. Nope. Q believers can be irritating because they are ineffective. I was there, I saw the agents provocateurs, and they did not look or act like Q nerds. They were driven and focused and violent in their affect. people shit on Q believers because they're ineffective. Because Q deals in hopium, which saps motivation. These were hardened communists... I'm somewhat familiar with the breed.
Totally different kettle of fish. [edit: they pulled a fast one, and we didn't see it coming. This was a very successful operation.]",11RhAsStqz,2
The fucking assholes have been identified and they have spent the last four years larping the shit.,11RhAsStqz,1
"My take is that Q is a false flag clown world project to generate sound bites/memes to make Trump voters look stupid. So there are really 2 kinds of Q people: those on the Deep State payroll creating/pushing Q content, and gullible Trump supporters who buy into it.",11RhAsStqz,1
"Nah. Nope. QTards are irritating, true. But they are irritating because they are ineffective. I was there, I saw the agents provocateurs, and they did not look or act like Q nerds. They were driven and focused and violent in their affect. The reason everybody shits on QTards is because they're ineffective dweebs. Because Q deals in hopium, which saps motivation. These were hardened communists... I'm somewhat familiar with the breed.
Totally different kettle of fish.",11RhAsStqz,1
"the hypocracy is insane, but not surprising.",11RhAsStqz,18
The hypocrisy is so loud I can't even hear myself think anymore.,11RhAsStqz,17
"Oh my God, when will Nancy and Chuck save us from these right-wingers and all this white supremacy!!!",11RhAsStqz,17
How do we protect ourselves? They sent in the national guard didn't they?,11RhAsStqz,1
"I'm feeling blackpilled, American Patriots will wake up to the shock that the Senate and House voted overwhelmingly against Trump, especially because of the breach into Capitol Hill. The DS betrayed all of us.",11RhAsStqz,16
"Patriots will wake up to knocks on their doors, their homes searched for weapons, warrants executed and it'll happen slowly and spread out so not enough Patriots catch on that they're being disarmed. Every law the Democrats have ever wanted they can now pass, and no civil liberties organization, no lawyer, no judge and no prayer will stop it.",11RhAsStqz,6
"I will put it this way. They had better use one of their illegal ""no knocks"" and be quiet when they enter because I will not have my property removed in that manner. I was abandoned by people I thought I could trust today but I'll be damned if I let the gestapo take what's mine from me without taking them along with me.",11RhAsStqz,4
"Not sure people realize that this won't be one law passed in Congress. They will slowly boil you over four years like a lobster and take away your rights. They will not attack you as a group, they will attack you one on one and by yourself.",11RhAsStqz,3
"WE DARED TO GO AGAINST THE ELITE WHO HATE US. that is why its the worst day. Just like rome, the senate knows best now let us maks ourselves rich while you starve, and they wonder why we make caeser references.",11RhAsStqz,16
The Republican Party will never win another election,11RhAsStqz,15
"Yes, they will. They have Dominion to help them. They don't need us.",11RhAsStqz,16
Of course they will. Plenty of RINOs to maintain the illusion of choice.,11RhAsStqz,14
Pretty much what I was going to say. They're going to keep up these fake elected officials as they further chip away at our society. Armageddon is China forcing Christians into Death Camps.,11RhAsStqz,3
"Fiery, but mostly peaceful protest. Stunning and brave. Awoman climbed through a window. Fucking terrorists.",11RhAsStqz,13
"yep... between that and all the fake tough guys larping about bUiLdiNg gALLoWs and bRinGiNg eNuF rOpE, this place can be goddamn insufferable.",11RhAsStqz,4
"sure man, any minute now",11RhAsStqz,2
"The difference is the consequences of an information war that's been raging for 30 years. It's not massed armies on battlefields, but it's war with real consequences.",11RhAsStqz,11
"Are you not tired of being treated that way? Time to have our own country, our own media, our own Internet, our own everything. Similar to China, but with more Freedoms (but no freedom to the commies).",11RhAsStqz,10
"There's always Greenland, but they're all pagans there. Not sure how I feel about dancing nude around a totem at night.",11RhAsStqz,3
And then you'd be twice the slave you are now.,11RhAsStqz,0
"I have absolutely nothing against Europe other than the fact that Western Europe is very liberal. Unfortunately, America is headed that direction soon.",11RhAsStqz,1
"They don't give a fuck. They are in session to have dramatic and emotional bullshit to hypnotize the masses again. Putting them to sleep and thwarting anyone against their agenda. ""But mah 2nd amendment.""
lol This place is an echo chamber for the naïve. It's over and be happy it's over. Now you can get mad and do some shit about it or shut up and go back to normie vision. Fight or die. All you dumbasses who were thinking we were gonna win from the Grace of God but without skin in the game, are fucking retarded. So this is the Rubicon. We are no longer Americans. If it were the case this shit would have ended. Doesn't even need to be violent. Just had to be manageable under a better party. But you guys sucked on conservatives cock and trusted law enforcement. Democrats and Republicans play on the same team. You're retarded for thinking otherwise. No chance now to make a new party though. Trump cucked out. lol",11RhAsStqz,9
"Well I for one, will immediately consult with a tax lawyer and make sure I pay as little as possible.",11RhAsStqz,3
"They are making campaign videos, nothing more. Worthless shitbags.",11RhAsStqz,2
Honestly the people did their part. Just too many dirty elites to handle without some sort of collapse.,11RhAsStqz,2
The solution to speech you don’t like isn’t to ban it This will push people to become more polarized The left only listens to China,11RhAsStqz,9
Hearing President Trump to make a statement tonight! Can anyone confirm? As soon as 30 minutes from now?,11RhAsStqz,8
I don’t think so.,11RhAsStqz,1
"Unfiery, but mostly violent insurrection.",11RhAsStqz,8
Had to turn off NewsMax when Sean Spicer started kissing ass.,11RhAsStqz,8
Rudy's drop from earlier- this guy is hyped about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbU5-NkbZ1A,11RhAsStqz,7
Damnit now my eyes hurt from rolling.,11RhAsStqz,1
These people are delusional - I've seen hundreds of people today suggesting that what happened today was worse than this summer. People shocked and appalled that it took hours to call in the national guard - are the same people that were horrified at that people could even consider law enforcement intervention after BLM and Antifa took over Seattle for 6 weeks complete with own warlords and police brutality.,11RhAsStqz,7
Got into a big argument with my bitch ass liberal brother over this.,11RhAsStqz,7
Holy shit. Ashli Babbitt the veteran that died today... the shit people are saying about her on facebook is horrible. https://www.facebook.com/1079255103/posts/10216598587332011/,11RhAsStqz,6
So sad. Make your profiles private everyone.,11RhAsStqz,1
"That sums it up! Great Meme, pede!",11RhAsStqz,6
That's a peaceful flame that is warmly embracing that building Fuck that tree for not joining in.,11RhAsStqz,6
"Now, it starts today",11RhAsStqz,2
"I was there today... Antifa was there too; on the way there they thought I was one of them because I had my MAGA gear stowed. They eventually figured out I was not one of them, but only after outing themselves. The StopTheSteal Protest was a PEACEFUL one! The Trump protesters were UNARMED! The police Pepper-Sprayed, Maced, and tear-gassed us without provocation! Not a joke! They did this BEFORE anything was torn down! The police shot unarmed protesters, without provocation, or imminent threat! They murdered that girl for being where they didn't want her!",11RhAsStqz,5
Just like Bidens votes certification happens at night,11RhAsStqz,5
This is exactly what's bugging me,11RhAsStqz,4

Post your proof.,11RhP10lcL,7
"Remember that scene in the The Patriot, where Mel and the French guy go into the tavern, and Mel shouts God Save King George, before they both quickly go out the door just before Knives and such land in the back side of the door ?

Source? Spez: Did not downvote but asking bc I’m usually a good judge of character and he looks off to me.,11RhP10lcL,2
Not as off as those who govern us.,11RhP10lcL,5
Those are a different breed. Guy in picture has the professional agitator look while this who govern us are elite assholes who smile pretty in pictures then tax us to oblivion.,11RhP10lcL,2
Did you get her laptop ?,11RhP10lcL,37
He needs a medal of freedom :),11RhP10lcL,13
Glowing? You seem to really hate this guy.,11RhP10lcL,16
Like you are spamming all over bases on hearsay,11RhP10lcL,16
If it is so post proof. Thats been a Standard here for awhile. Until then this is a fellow Patriot who actually got off his ass to do something! Whether you agree with it or not.,11RhP10lcL,3
He's facing one year in prison,11RhP10lcL,163
"He's a patriot and a political prisoner. More will join him I'm sure, unless Trump acts.",11RhP10lcL,262
"Breaking and entering, most likely. Mayhem. Conspiracy maybe? Riot? Whatever they can throw at him to deter us in the future. All garbage. He just sat there. BLM killed, burned, destroyed, robbed. They were all let go.",11RhP10lcL,126
"And the evil, hypocrisy, ect displayed by our criminal ruling class will make people's anger keep growing. Wait till they coming for guns or when they start putting people in Covid forced quarantine detention camps",11RhP10lcL,55

"And that's whay we should be proud we marched into Congress instead of pathetically bleating ""but antifa really did it."" It was long past time that Congress got stormed, so let's make sure we take the credit for it.",11RhP10lcL,56
"Yep, I keep saying that they are responding to January 6 in entirely the wrong way. It's only making people angrier and angrier. Eventually BLM, ANTIFA, and MAGA are going to realize that we all have the same common enemy, and then January 6 will look like a cake walk.",11RhP10lcL,27
"Better yet, DON'T wait for that! (Which is surely coming)",11RhP10lcL,4
Well he came in from the other side where the cops let people just walk in so no breaking and entering there.,11RhP10lcL,33
He needs a good lawyer.,11RhP10lcL,28
The way these judges are setup let’s see who comes to his rescue. Lin seems busy.,11RhP10lcL,9
"He needs us. He should have never even been arrested. As we saw with Kyle and countless other examples, political prisoners is a regular and accepted occurrence in out country now. 😞",11RhP10lcL,5

For trespassing and probably for being out after curfew depending on what time he was there,11RhP10lcL,2
He stole a piece of mail from her office and posted pics with it. Federal crime to steal mail. Unfortunately they will trash him for it and they will know they are being total cunts while doing it.,11RhP10lcL,35
What is the crime for backdating mail for a fake ballot? Under Biden it will be a cash prize and some kind of medal I think.,11RhP10lcL,39
a crime is not a crime unless they say so.,11RhP10lcL,8
Right and Wrong are constructs of the patriarchy bigot.,11RhP10lcL,3
Cash prize is right.,11RhP10lcL,5
"'Mail' is no longer official, at the snap of a finger, anyone in the globalist party can make mail post dated.",11RhP10lcL,19
That's precisely what makes it official. Catch up.,11RhP10lcL,5
Well Nancy IS a rancid cunt so....,11RhP10lcL,14
He left a quarter on her desk for the envelope. That’s much different,11RhP10lcL,13
None of it should count since we have a rogue group perpetrating a coup on our Republic and trying to remove a sitting President.,11RhP10lcL,8
Could be worse; he could have broken a window. Then he'd have gotten shot to death.,11RhP10lcL,16
Deep. Never forget.,11RhP10lcL,4
"I’m not trying to argue, but are we even sure she was the one that actually broke it to begin with? Thanks in advance.",11RhP10lcL,3
Time for revolution 2.0. And no I'm not inciting violent conflict either. Look up the Philippines EDSA revolution in 1986. When they canned Marcos. That's how it's done people!,11RhP10lcL,2
"It shouldn't deter us, we honer this man and all our patriots.
I would be disappointed if we don't have more like him over the next few years.

Buy Bitcoin and Ethereum. They are going to print money and raise taxes.
Protect yourself and take action where you can.
We win by understanding their weakness and profiting off it.",11RhP10lcL,40
We need his name and the location he's being held after he's sentenced so folks can send him mail for entertainment while he's held as a political prisoner,11RhP10lcL,10
We need forms of communication the way Big Tech is trending.,11RhP10lcL,4
These turncoats are the absolute worst and have no excuse. Absolutely none.,11RhP10lcL,2
they could ban virtual currency,11RhP10lcL,0
They won’t ban it just make their version the only one you can use and own. They’ll use the poor unbanked as a pretext and turn us into literal crypto batteries,11RhP10lcL,3

"He has more courage than most people in this country. He thinks he's alone in this fight. And I feel for him. We need to show him we can fight with him. He's our champion, but we need to be his.",11RhP10lcL,7
Stop running around like headless chickens.,11RhP10lcL,4

Waiting til Bidet is CiC before we do anything is NOT a winning strategy,11RhP10lcL,1

Kill a Trump supporter in Seattle execution style? FBI doesn’t even investigate. Sit in Nancy’s desk? CRIME OF THE CENTURY,11RhP10lcL,508
Wait did they interview him?,11RhP10lcL,53
Yep then shortly later shootout with police and killed.,11RhP10lcL,68
There were indications that the interview is how the law figured out how to catch up with him.,11RhP10lcL,27
But the point is that VICE did not interview him hoping that the police would find and kill him.,11RhP10lcL,30
"No, of course not. Though I could see sleazy journalists doing that.",11RhP10lcL,4
That Sounds more like they put him in something like “witness protection”,11RhP10lcL,1
They interviewed him cause we have a two tiered justice system.,11RhP10lcL,15

Have. Not for me. When I first encountered their claims I saw it for what I still think it to be: people with great ideas but insufficient power to bring them to pass. Meanwhile heads of security in DC have resigned.,11RhP10lcL,2
And neither is America let’s fucking Gooooo,11RhP10lcL,5
All heads of security in DC are resigned right now,11RhP10lcL,1
Enemies of the State are always labelled terrorists. This is how we know we are on the right side of history and they are evil fascists.,11RhP10lcL,60

Mussolini was a communist before making his Fascist party.,11RhP10lcL,5
Two sides of the same coin.,11RhP10lcL,4
They're not mutually exclusive diametrically opposed systems like the left says... communism always leads to fascism. You can have fascism without communism but you can't have communism without fascism.,11RhP10lcL,2

"We have all had the same enemies since before blm existed and it was Occupy Wall St and we were the tea party. Back then Occupy was against corporations that had too much power and tea party was against government that had too much power. Our enemies are the same, our goals are the same, and we should be working together. Back then nobody on either side was willing to acknowledge this. TPTB have succeeded with their divide and conquer strategy so now both sides are so radical it's very unlikely we will ever unite.",11RhP10lcL,2
Depressingly true. This is why the media needs to go. COVID-1984 really was the nail in the coffin. The media ratings were down until they ratcheted up the fear porn. The elected leaders were a joke until they latched onto the ‘flatten the curve’ virtue signaling. Trump got destroyed by the mail-ins. It would take a deus ex machina event to have every one focus on one common enemy.,11RhP10lcL,1
"The issue wasn't BLM revolting. They were doing so based on the most grotesque lies. They were played by racists exploiting their own racism. Rayshard was not shot while asleep in his car. Taylor was not shot while asleep in her bed. Trayvon was not shot for wearing a hoodie. Floyd was killed by a drug dealer, the same people protesting his death because they have a beef with the police. BLM are retards. They joined the army of the enemy they're fighting against. They were played. To be honest it's sad but this is the true scope of evil we are fighting. They have played us a bit as well giving us false signals of election fraud throwing us off the trail. What the hell is up with there being real problems with mail in voting to suddenly weird stuff happening electronically in Europe with nothing solid to substantiate it? Who planted that and who kept people out of the dark to be able to rule it in or out? I don't like it but we and BLM have a real grievance against deceivers and manipulators. BLM should be enraged about being lied to by their leaders and the media about police brutality. We are enraged about being denied election transparency. BLM really has a lot more to answer to but it's also the same evil making them their fool as well as trying to fool us. They have seeded some lies among us that have taken root but weed them out and our cause still has merit but it's not so much for BLM. Sucks to be them I guess. We're not perfect but we're by far not the worst and we are ultimately in the right. It's not just the fighting but what it's for. If this game is to big for you don't worry big daddy is here. You can follow behind me like an infantry man and the tank.",11RhP10lcL,1
"""America was founded by terrorists for terrorists."" Say what you will about the latter half of that, but it's undeniable the founders were terrorists by definition. Violence and asymmetrical warfare??? ""the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims."" They overthrew an empire because taxes. Fuck. Everyone even in the civil war was a terrorist by that definition. You ready for the next part- anyone with an office and an army behind them a is terrorist. 1776 or 2021. We've gotten a little off our rocker here boys. You realize how terrorist and patriot are the same thing just depends on who is in power at the time and who the opfor is.Germans in WWII believed they were patriots. Divide and rule is not a new strategy my dudes. TL:DR- everyone sucks and is a piece of shit. Also birds aren't real",11RhP10lcL,4
"The problem with terrorism is, as you say, how loosely it's defined. When common people hear the word terrorist, they imagine people indiscriminately attacking innocent and unrelated civilians - or attacking parts of government that have legitimacy by public approval. ANTIFA fits that definition perfectly, yet the establishment claims they don't exist, because they don't have an official board of director or some shit. Meanwhile, no common citizen would call people terrorists who conduct TARGETED attacks against parts of system that do not have public approval. Yet that's exactly how governments use the term: ""Enemies of the state"". So the term is entirely biased towards government interests - not public interests. It's exactly the same as with the concept of treason: Treason against the government exists in law, but treason against the public/nation has no legal representation. Many of our concepts are straight up out of feudalism - not a nation that bases power on the people. The concepts of terrorism and treason are just two of those stonage-relics.",11RhP10lcL,4

He really left a quarter?,11RhP10lcL,84
Really. It's just too funny for words. He was interviewed and it's on one of those interviews. He said he didn't want to be accused of stealing. I think he really got under Nancy's skin with the feet up on her desk. No one does that to the Queen!,11RhP10lcL,115
She's lucky he didn't take a shit and then smear it into hidden nooks and cranny's in her office. She would be smelling his shit for years.,11RhP10lcL,23

It was totes fine when that arrogant Kenyan put his filthy shoes on the resolute desk everyday though 👍,11RhP10lcL,9
"He also said he scratched his balls in her chair 🤣 The envelope deal is he realized he was bleeding. Assuming he didn’t want to bleed everywhere he grabbed an envelope to catch the blood. Instead of just pocketing the envelope he laid a quarter down and told cops on the way out he paid for it! LOL! You can see in the pic of him sitting at her desk the pointer finger does have a trickle of blood running down and the envelope has a blood stain on it. What a dangerous criminal he is, they should throw Killary’s book of the damned at him! 😂",11RhP10lcL,49

Trump should file a sexual harassment suit. What do you think tearing up that speech was about? She's distraught she can't get his attention.

Scared of what at this point. We are being memory holed. They will not make the same mistake of 2015.

It's far more then 50% of the country who don't believe the results of the 2020 election. It's really the vast majority of Americans. There are plenty of run of the mill dems who are not buying into this two shams and a travesty of an election.,11RhOzrYY9,49

"This is exactly correct. They are trying to project strength and it's costing them half the country forever. Republican Senators can't even show their faces in public without being run out by their own voters, to the laughter of the liberals who always hated them. They can't mass arrest us because we're armed to the teeth and 80% of law enforcement is sympathetic. As soon as any leader arises and makes the call for a ""mostly peaceful protest"" in any capitol building they're going to have 100's of thousands of people getting more bold every time. They've got a big fucking problem.",11RhOzrYY9,37
We're going to see shit happening at a local level. They will have to lock down so hard and it will just make people more pissed.,11RhOzrYY9,19

Probably dont even need that the new admin is everyday losing confidence. Thats why they think getting rid of Trump permanently will help them. They are to stupid and egotistical to accept its themselves causing this and think in getting rid of Trump will in some way absorb his support. They have zero grasp on understanding that Trump does not control the thought processes of his supporters because they come from a world where they belive they control the narrative with MSM and Social Media.,11RhOzrYY9,13

Why won't you just be a good boy and roll over like all of their other pets? ...it doesn't make any sense! You are all acting like you can think for yourselves and that you'll live free or die instead! Their Chinese buyers are getting impatient.

"Not really... They don't have total power now. Not by any stretch of the imagination. It's a mirage. They only control the government. (or so we are told at this moment) Every single communist revolution that has ever taken place in over a century now (since Communism was invented just after the American Civil War) the nation that had been targeted by the Communists had been disarmed well before the revolution came above board to the people. Right now these communists are staring down the face of an armed population of 350+ Million Americans who privately own at least 3 times that number of firearms. That we are aware of. Like the admiral of the Japanese navy during WW-2 said to the Emperor of Japan when he strongly advised the emperor NOT to invade the American mainland. ""There will be a weapon behind every blade of grass.""",11RhOzrYY9,10

I was taking all those institutions you list for granted when I said government. What I should have said was they control the Talmudic Kabballistic Communist New World Order for the Ages. Because that is what we all are truly fighting against. What we have on our side is much more powerful. We have the power of the people on our side. Plus we have hundreds of thousands in the military and retired military who will fight on the side of the people... Because they have families too. Plus we have many other thousands of oath keepers and the like. Against a comparably small group of people who (AT THE MOMENT) control all the institutions that you correctly listed above... Besides that... (as far as I'm concerned) We have the one true living creator God Almighty on our side as well. He is really all we need. Thank you very much for your reply.,11RhOzrYY9,1
"Maybe they should be scared... But they definitely aren't. And should they be, even? Their control of the media and tech has 40% of the population believing that we're the bad guys. We'll know pretty soon, because if serious action isn't taken before they have the government, then they will do a false flag terrorist attack (and it'll be obvious that it's a false flag because it won't take out any high value target) and then they will declare us all terrorists. They will use the military against us. If that is to be prevented it needs to be soon.",11RhOzrYY9,8
"Honestly, in this day and age; I think the ""biggest"" thing we have going for us is the sheer size of the country. Back in the day the bigger countries were easier to brutalize through ism because you couldn't get news from one end to the other nearly as quickly (Which is why they are attempting to disrupt comms now). However, I believe the opposite to be true now and they can't really black out our country like they could much smaller territories, the sheer size of this country is will end up being its only saving grace.",11RhOzrYY9,6

That way, with El Paso metro area carrying on as Texas (the state), no state need secede and we can therefore bypass the 1869 precdent of Texas v. White which ruled that secession is somehow unconstitutional. Most other red states can follow suit by redrawing their borders and cedeing the bulk of their land and people that will then join the new nation. If this country continues to cling onto the illusion that a single Constitution and founding means a single sovereign nation and one-size fit all solution for all 300+ million Americans, then it will only subject itself to all the horrors and unrest of the Christian Reformation. At best, it ends in a new Westphalian system of sovereign American nations defined by differing denominations of the American civic religion.

They dont need to disarm you anymore, yesterday showed nobody has the audactiy to use them. Think about it like this: They have been censoring ONLY Conservatives from all main social media platforms; they put you under house arrest and told you you cannot work; they stole an election in broad daylight and rubbed it in your face. Now they are putting you on lists to blackball you from employment for having the ""wrong"" politics. Jan 6th should have been the critical mass for all of this. The Revolution should have started then.

WITH A FLAG IN HER ARMS,11RhAukWF0,15
"They rolled into town a million strong. knowing that the odds were long. in their bones it was wrong. For the rules of liberty did congress flout So patriots came, to call them to account.
Upon the capitol they did walk. with no other intentions, but to talk. Nary a court would have their say. Their last hopes, that Pence would save the day.
Soon their hopes were dashed. Just like their ballots trashed.
Thus they did proceed to take the floor. Just so they could not ignore. The elites they panicked in their fear. As the unarmed patriots brought up the rear.
Then in their ire, they had their pigs lash out. So they shot that unarmed girl for no other reason, Then she deigned to call them on their treason.
Rally patriots, as there will be no balm, so long as freedom lost let there be no calm.
Always remember, they'll take your wealth. They'll control your health. The chains invisible, but still they bind.
For American spring is soon to be the season. Just remember, they shot that girl for no reason. Only because she deigned to call them on their treason.",11RhAukWF0,22

"In America, conservative whites best character trait is also their biggest weakness, and the left are masters of taking advantage of it. What I speak of is of course that trait of rugged American individualism. We are the least tribalistic to a fault, and that only works in a truly free country with a small government where checks and balances still matter, oh yeah, and elections are still real. White folks are also the only demographic who will openly, and proudly fight tooth and nail for policies that bring about their own suicides while also fighting for other demos who openly and proudly take advantage of them many times even with violence.

"If you had paid proper attention starting from 2016 election, you would see that Pence didn't always agree with Trump. He was always an establishment Republican. The reason trump chose him was because Pence was an establishment Republican. He needed an establishment Republican support to get his agenda rolling in Congress. ...
...you don't need Lin Wood to see that Pence will immediately backstab Trump the second bitch McConnell turned.....and there was a reason Trump bought up Pence last few days in couple if tweets and during GA rally.
Remember trump said he HOPES Pence will come through for us. If Trump was sure, he would have said Pence WILL come through for us, but instead he used HOPES. This was a dead giveaway that Pence will be backstabbing Trump.... You failed to see it, you don't need Lin Wood for this, this is called critical thinking and common sense... Lol

The glowie will be the one trying to plan things, writing things down or just really impatient to ""do something"". Read the FBI depositions of other groups they have infiltrated, it is usually pretty clear how they operate. In general planning things and ""purchasing supplies"" are hugely illegal and should not be done for any reason whatsoever. There should be a no gun and no fed-talk rule at all of these clubs. Glowies will have an agenda and they will be impatient, especially with how many targets they are going to have in the coming years. Be patient, prepare yourself and don't be afraid to work hard. Ultimately, being a political dissident under an oppressive regime is risky. Your life will be less comfortable, you get fewer vacations, and you might end up in a gulag somewhere. I try to maintain the perspective of my ancestors, they may rule over us, but they can not make me repeat their lies, and they can not make me submit. The goal should be to make yourself a hard target, so when they come to demand you get on your knees you can meet almighty God ontop of a pile of pigs. Many enemies, Much honor.",11RhAukWF0,2

Simply fired on civilian population for coming inside a perimeter.",11RhAukWF0,5

Don't get over the top in your social media, but don't surrender and don't apologize for the mostly peaceful events of the day. There was fraud, they stole the fucking election and we have the proof, therefore January 6th was justified.

And spread that Lindsay Graham video everywhere, especially to your liberal friends. Remember, project strength--show their weakness. But do it in real life. What facebook and twitter are doing is a blessing because it will finally motivate a shift online.

Theyve refused to listen to us or acknowledge us for years prior. If they are SO CERTAIN there is no fraud, all they had to do was an independent and accurate audit of the election to make us all look like the idiots we are....but they dont choose the path of transparency, they've chosen to hide in the shadows and attempted to use their power to force their desired outcome. Explain to people that we simply sought an audience with those who claim to govern and represent us and they failed miserably in their response.

"Yeah you have to know the exact details, they matter and that's why its important to just get one story completely right. The first ""audit"" was just a hand recount of the physical ballots which everyone already suspected were printed or mailed in fraudulently. It was carried out by the same people who we suspected of cheating in the first place and observors in the leftwing counties were kept far away as usual. They claimed to see suspicious looking ""mail in"" ballots without creases but of course nothing could be done about that because everyone you complain to calls you a liar. Then they did another recount using the dominion machines again after the election was certified, again with the same corrupt vote counters. Then Raffensperger partnered with the ""unbiased"" University of Georgia to ""audit"" the mail in ballot signatures. But they only audited Cobb county, not Fulton county where everyone expected the fuckery to have occured, and they came to the absurdly unlikely conclusion that only two out of 15,000 signatures didn't match correctly, and when they called the people up directly to ask them if they voted they said yes. So all told, Cobb county had a perfect record of signature verification! At no point was Trump's team allowed to do a forensic analysis of the machines in Fulton or the physical ballots in order to check whether they were printed off. At no point was anybody outside of Raffensperger's office, aside from the cucks at the University of Georgia, ever even allowed to take part in these ""audits"" and so forth. It's all a farce.",11RhTbywLY,18
"Do we want a ""independent"" investigation or a Trump investigation? If were mad about Trump not getting access, then we're not mad about not getting an independent investigation. Has anyone actually looked deeply into the findings of the hand count and the independent audit. Getting really tired of the subject always moving from one thing to the next. Trump called for a hand recount, they did it, then they found another reason to want something else, they try to prove that and they want something different. Look, I'm a lifelong Republican, these last few weeks have really shaken my confidence. Lots of people who were nobodies before are making lots of money perporting lots of ways the election was stolen, they've got reason to bullshit too, almost more than Raffensburger. Unless you believe he was a secret Dem or they have ""something"" on him, but the officials in Ga have been on the up and up every time before this, so I don't get it.

"I was a poli sci major. My thesis was “The Life Cycle of Empires.” Not exactly groundbreaking. But I thought my conclusion was: the end stage is “decadence.” It is hall marked by an irreligious society, with no morals or common sense of decency. The more decadent the society, the more detached the society is from the tenets the society was built upon. It’s so comfortable, it begins to hate its own land. This rots the society from the inside out. Look at Athens. Look at Rome. Look at Byzantium. Look at England. Now look at America. Interesting to note: America was colonized by people who believed religious mores were lost in England. Result? A country more prosperous than England. Rome was lost to decadence - and then experienced a wide sweeping revival with the installation of the Church. More interesting: the Church has now entered “decadence.” Morality gets a bad rap because the Left aligns it with religious zealots. Man needs morality - to save itself from decadence. Specifically to stop from sliding into want of power, wealth and lust.",11RhTbywLY,30
"Are you a Christian? I grew up going to church and fell out of it in teenage years. Then got into all sorts of debauchery and sin in a period of early adulthood when I was claiming I didn't believe in any sort of creator. I was truly a lost soul. I did have some good times. I used to go to all sorts of parties and raves and drugs and sex. I thought I was supposed to live like the guys in motley crue (except I wasn't quite on that level). I learned really hard when I lost someone who meant everything to me at the time. It humbled me and made me not want to have fun anymore. I was really depressed and didn't eat anything for about 3 days. I sort of fumbled around a few months dazed and confused but I started to have all these memories of the things I was told growing up about Jesus. I joined a church and they even baptised me. On my 30th birthday. I got dunked in the water but I felt like it was only symbolic. For I had already been cleansed of my filthyness when I decided to live for HIM. Like it or not we were born to honor our creator. That is why he made us in his image. I truly believe this. America, please MAKE JESUS GREAT AGAIN. We will not continue to be a great nation on this current road.",11RhTbywLY,18
"Yep. I’m a devout Catholic now. I’d say from ages 10-25, I was a lapsed Catholic - and found myself wanting “empty” things. I believed in God, but just strayed. Similar to you, I lost someone. For whatever reason, I went to confession and just lashed out at the Priest. The Priest somewhat smiled and said “You can’t be angry at something that doesn’t exist, correct?” It snapped me right back into my faith. I still falter. But, I sort of look at a faith filled life as being on a boat. Some days, you encounter strong headwinds. Maybe you even take on water. But your destination always remains the same.

You can be angry and sometimes that’s a righteous anger that leads to revelation. I think the point is a lot of atheists aren’t hard atheists. They don’t disbelieve in God they are just dissatisfied with something and want to tear him down as if that were possible,11RhTbywLY,2

Virtue leads to happiness and real inner peace. Not fake virtue -- real virtue.",11RhTbywLY,1
I could agree that Rome didn't fall. We could probably even make the argument that it became stronger as the Church. It is in total free fall right now - because of its decadence.,11RhTbywLY,1

"There's also the fact that polling is a business. They aren't doing it as a public good. As such, there are internal numbers that the paying client gets, and public numbers that the client wants published. Both of them serve different purposes, and the pollster can fudge the results based on what questions they ask and who they ask. It all depends on what the client wants (different for PACs vs TV channels) and how much they are willing to pay. It's market research and market manipulation. This is one of those open secrets that I'm surprised more people don't know.",11RhTbywLY,3

"They don’t care about how many people support Trump, or conservatism, or liberalism, or socialism today... Their goal is simply to have a generation of people grow up with this level of control of speech and ideas being normal. The default goal of any person or group who has power is to increase their power. You can see it in your office, when the wrong type of person gets promoted to be a manager, and they just start micromanaging everybody. You can see it in the government when every single year they regulate our lives more and more. You can see it in these media companies, where every strategic decisions they make is designed to give them more control over the flow of information, and the ability of people to express themselves. They’ve already gotten away with it. It doesn’t matter how much we despise it. The only thing that matters is whether they can get away with it long enough for enough people to grow up with this being completely normal.

The fact the “crisis” only exists in the headlines of the newspapers, and in the deluded pr releases these companies are making doesn’t matter. Almost every headline around the world says Trump had been banned to prevent him “inciting further violence”. It’s just the finishing move from these big media companies.",11RhTbywLY,2

Was just talking about that today. It will start when they add all the job killing regulations and taxes. Never underestimate their ability to screw things up and piss people off.

What Twitter did is literally a threat to national security. What if China sent a fucking nuke our way rn and he couldn't tell us? Edit: This site gives me much needed hope and sanity. I love you guys,11RhOzrpb9,570
"It's his personal account. And we have every right to be outraged, but the official POTUS account is still there: https://twitter.com/POTUS Trump never used it, probably because he doesn't have control of it, and it's only been used for press releases and PR. EAS would be used for a nuke launch. Maybe. I have my doubts they'd warn us.",11RhOzrpb9,278
Why would they warn us of a nuke they launched. 🤔,11RhOzrpb9,133
Our defense system would know the moment it launched,11RhOzrpb9,41
He's asking why the chinese commies in charge of our government would warn us of a nuke they sent our way.,11RhOzrpb9,72
Unless we just so happened to be in the middle of a wargame scenario and couldn't tell the difference.,11RhOzrpb9,29
Like in Hawai.. lol.,11RhOzrpb9,14
Our defense system could not even keep a half naked dude with bullhorns out of the capitol for 15 mintues.... You give our 'defensive grid' too much credit,11RhOzrpb9,5

Twitter has said that the POTUS account would go to biden on january 20th and that they will wipe the followers list.. FUCK TWITTER,11RhOzrpb9,60
"Haha, Biden was salty about that too, he wanted the followers cause he is gonna have 1-2 million, kek kek kek!",11RhOzrpb9,65
They will inflate his follower count with so many Bots. It’ll be a nice bit of levity in an otherwise very dark time with nothing resembling an “end” at even the furthest of horizons.,11RhOzrpb9,27
The truth will be exposed in their desire to destroy Trump's legacy,11RhOzrpb9,19
not when they flood it with bots like his personal twitter. Go start looking through them and click. The accounts have like 1-10 followers. It is a thin veneer.,11RhOzrpb9,14
"Please, in 24 hours it would go from two million to two dozen",11RhOzrpb9,13
GEOTUS SHOULD CLOSE THE POTUS ACCOUNT Executive order: All goverment accounts (police etc) can not use twitter.,11RhOzrpb9,39
let's not pretend that it had anything to do with Donald Trump breaking any rules.. his suspension was because he was targeted SPECIFICALLY in retaliation for running against the Democrat Party It has NOTHING to do with any of their excuses.. it's 100% retaliation and an attempt to prevent anybody in the country from standing up to the Democrat Party..,11RhOzrpb9,50
Trump asked for the followers list to be wiped. They wouldn’t do it if he didn’t ask for it.,11RhOzrpb9,11
"Eh, I think they would. It makes Biden more dependent on Twitter and other big tech to prop him up, and gives them leverage over him. He does what they want or he starts getting more and more censored and banned. Less followers means less people care.",11RhOzrpb9,7
"Yo everyone who can, let's short the shit out of TWTR on Monday. It's already starting",11RhOzrpb9,7
i already did when they banned my boi don,11RhOzrpb9,3
"Yeah but you could argue the same thing they argued to stop from being blocked on it, that it's still limiting one of the primary avenues he uses to communicate. He could choose to talk through two tin cans and a wire and if they come and snip the wire, they are limiting his reach regardless if he has other methods. Either way any reduction in his ability to communite either serious or not is a win for foreign powers and opens up the potential that the President might not be able to effectively reach the maximum number of people during a crisis.",11RhOzrpb9,14
I'm not excusing what they did. It's cowardly and more fascist than anything they've accused us of. He still has avenues of communication for his role of President. Maybe. That's all I'm saying.,11RhOzrpb9,7
Right? Can’t use a tragedy as a pretense for war if you don’t let the tragedy happen.,11RhOzrpb9,6
"We are at war 100%. Modern war. The President is almost entirely cut off from any ability to communicate with the a nation, supporters or not.

This is so much bigger than Trump and it is even bigger than our Country alone. We know China and Russia have been moving forces close to our shores recently. China has had soldiers training in land they own in Canada, etc. I am
not sure if China’s goal is to ever invade us, but they may not even have to. If Biden is sworn in, he will resign because of dementia, or Covid (which now is so clearly a minimally deadly virus that they released on purpose and at a specific time right before an election year to pave the way for “the most widespread and effective voter fraud organization this country has ever seen” - Joe Biden, Michael Scott.) With Biden removed, Kamala steps in and we are little more than West China. Invading us to occupy and totally destroy the USA remains a very dumb decision to make because of the 2A and our superior military, but China knows that and that’s why they have overtaken us from within for many decades. A slow march through our political and cultural institutions. 20-30 years ago, China identified America’s/American’s biggest, most vulnerable and exploitable weakness; Greed, money, and a total lust for power. The used that weakness to slowly chip away at our country from within over many years. Fuck them, but it is a genius strategical approach. I don’t know what the coming days, months and years will entail, but make no mistake we are at war right now, and we have never been more vulnerable for foreign attacks on our Country than perhaps we have ever been. We are almost entirely divided within and we are about to (absent a miracle, which I believe in, and am refusing to give up hope, for my own sanity and well being until 1/20/21. I’m not “trust the plan” but I’m just clinging on for hope.) We are at war. Period. The People are at war with Big Tech, the MSM, and the Uniparty/Radical Left, and our Country is at war with both itself and China. We are in a civil war right now if you ask me. It’s just a cold civil war. Slowly boiling. Like the 3 year period between the Boston Massacre and the Civil War. This time though, I’m not sure if it will take 3 years for this powder keg to go off. I don’t want that and have no idea what would happen, but IMO it feels inevitable at this point, especially if they begin to reign down their full Agenda. Socialism, exiling Trump supporters from living any normal life, and taking our liberties because we are terrorists for supporting him. They are coming for us all. Godspeed fellow Patriots.

China has a China First policy and they want nothing to do with all the constant bickering over toilets, gender, race etc. Actually if we didn't have these losers in reserve, we would have gotten a much better trade deal with them.

98%. I’m with ya.,11RhOzrpb9,5
No. There are not 300k Chinese soldiers on our border. Give me a fucking break and show me what deranged source you have so I know not to trust them anymore.,11RhOzrpb9,10
Honestly why the hell would they even need them? Our current crop of Democrats RINOs & evil people are doing such a good job destroying the country by themselves. It's not happening.,11RhOzrpb9,5
"Sure. But that isn’t what I’m asking for. I’m simply asking for a source that 300k Chinese troops are on the Canadian border. I’m receiving downvotes for asking for more information. We are the side of truth. Yet no one can provide a source. I think we are being infiltrated by people who want to make us look like idiots, so when people make outrageous claims, I want to see them backed up.",11RhOzrpb9,3
Not sure bout 300000 but there are some over there. China did make a statement about sending more troops over if trodue wanted,11RhOzrpb9,0
"Ok. I asked for proof that 300k Chinese soldiers were at our border. The truth matters. No one has even given me a claim to look at. I’m tired of being infiltrated by liars, that is how we lost the White House and let down the greatest president in a generation. I won’t stand for people not sourcing claims and lying to us anymore.

"I understand where you are coming from, but you are giving out enemy too much credit. They are wicked, evil, and corrupt to the very core, but I do not believe they are smart enough or strategic enough to think about making
Sure there are logical reasons as to why we aren’t hearing from him. If they had him, his “concession video” would have actually used the word concede, and would have said the words “President Elect Joe Biden”
At some point. Further, Pelosi and Co. are in absolute panic. 25A, Impeachment, trying to get the nuclear codes taken from him, etc. they would not be acting this way if they had this all wrapped up, and I firmly believe they are no wise or cunning
Enough to have devised this panic as a cover for trying to make us think Trump is alive and free but just laying low. They are idiots, but they have to know that if a mere whiff of any attempted harm to him or his family would set an army of millions to DC to overthrow and kill every treasonous snake that has now been fully exposed after the certification Wednesday. Call me crazy, idgaf. I am clinging to
Hope as long as I can, but I am also preparing for likely reality. At this point, Trump has exposed the corruption and its depth to an undeniable level, and awoken probably close to 1/3 of the country to it while also awakening at least 15 million Patriots willing to fight and die for the Republic. If he and his family leave office and go spend the rest of their lives on a beach in Jamaica or some shit, I would be thankful and happy they made it out alive. He deserves to rest and live his days out safe and in peace. We can take it from here.",11RhOzrpb9,6

They played us, and beat us badly. They aren't panicking: they've won. Now they are being vindictive and evil. They are not afraid: they are powerful.",11RhOzrpb9,-1
It’s pretty fucking obvious they told him to lay low for 2 weeks or get removed,11RhOzrpb9,18
"Trump said before the election. At some point I may have to dissappear for a while.(or such).
He knows what he is doning.",11RhOzrpb9,27
Yes I remember him saying that. Good observation fren.,11RhOzrpb9,9
They're trying to remove him anyway.,11RhOzrpb9,10
This is the correct answer.,11RhOzrpb9,17
My friend works in a government job that keeps the airspace safe for the president's aircraft. Trump is fine.,11RhOzrpb9,14
"Forward a message for me. Dear GEOTUS, Please arrest a commie or two. Signed,
American about to get gulaged",11RhOzrpb9,17
What would be the point? Appeal to SC then off the hook. The only way is the military or civil war. Praying President Trump does what is needed before Jan 20.,11RhOzrpb9,3
Donald Jr would let us know if something was going down with his father.,11RhOzrpb9,8
How? They're all suspended,11RhOzrpb9,2
Jr is active currently on FB. He posted about his dad being banned from Twitter permanently and how we're all in an Orwellian situation right now.,11RhOzrpb9,11
Ding ding ding ding ding! This.,11RhOzrpb9,52
At least that's good news. Looks like they''re now worried about the declass coming out.,11RhOzrpb9,28
Not the cia still get the black out Information. Videos will be sent to every ones phones soon. He will bypass this big t altogether,11RhOzrpb9,6
Because it gives them a good excuse to pretend that he is NOT dead or imparied when he may really be.,11RhOzrpb9,9
"The United States is the PEOPLE. The United States Government doesn't exist at this point because they do not have the CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED!. They occupy the seats of power, but it is not JUST POWER. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it",11RhOzrpb9,-2
Curious why this got downvoted?,11RhOzrpb9,1
Twitter operates under protections given to utility companies. Utilities are supposed to be available to everyone. Your logic fails.,11RhOzrpb9,2

"Does going to these lengths make any sense when you have already secured your ""victory"" their guy will have full control in 2 weeks supposedly, why bother? Why 25th amendment? I thought they won? This is not the shit people who are confident do. We are not the ones with our backs against the wall. Trump is still potus for 2 weeks they are shitting themselves. Don't let the script get flipped. We caught them off guard in 2016 and they have been sitting themselves ever since trying to regain control.",11RhOzrpb9,16
They're gonna come for the guns.,11RhOzrpb9,3
"and when and if they do, hit em right between their stupid eyes.",11RhOzrpb9,4
"Because they hate trump. It’s just about fucking him harder, not because they’re afraid or anything else.",11RhOzrpb9,0
and why do they hate him? remind yourself of the past 4 years for the answer why. All of them were comfortably kicking back and cruising along eating their designer ice cream from 20k fridges while slowly driving us toward global communism until all of a sudden against all odds their golden girl lost to a reality tv billionaire from NY. Ever since then they've been scrambling to regain control. These people have put in work hours they've never done in their entire careers which is why they all look like fucking hell and have aged 20 years. GEOTUS interfered with everything they had going and woke up a sleeping titan. Now this raging fire is out of their control completely and only growing bigger by the day.,11RhOzrpb9,1

they are just getting millions of more people woken up and pissed off,11RhOzrpb9,3

"trump should never trusted twitter in the first place. he gave them a lot of business. he should had made ""tweets"" on his own website",11RhOzrpb9,93
Oh fuck you. He used their platform against them and reached people all over the world. You don’t use a platform to only talk to your echo chamber.,11RhOzrpb9,66
It's not as if he can't go somewhere else and get the word out.,11RhOzrpb9,8
His Parler is a backup of many of his tweets,11RhOzrpb9,5
Should have been the other way around. Primarily use Parler and use an API to automatically crosspost to Twitter after 1 hour. Supports friendlier media first and gets the reach of the evil media second.,11RhOzrpb9,7
What is his parler PLEASE?? I can't find it,11RhOzrpb9,2
Parler has been shut down. Google removed it from the play store and apple says they will do the same....when I try to open mine it times out and won't load.. they coming for everything 😡,11RhOzrpb9,-1

WE. ARE. BEING. CONQUERED!",11RhOzrpb9,1
I can't get in either. Probably millions of MAGA trying to get in at the same time and tens of millions trying to create accounts.,11RhOzrpb9,0
"you mean his gab, he does not have parler (ceo of parler have his name reserved for him waiting). Only team trump created parler recently (if not fake)",11RhOzrpb9,1
"He had Facebook, instagram, etc.",11RhOzrpb9,1
sigh They're not platforms. They're publishers....,11RhOzrpb9,5
And the smaller ones have zero reach and would also collapse under deep state pressure. The only alternative would have been to develop his own platforms.,11RhOzrpb9,0
"Why the past tense? Could still happen. He should get together with some people like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. We need a sustantial counterweight against the Silicon Valley totalitarian ""elite"".",11RhOzrpb9,0
"That was perfectly anticipated years ago... If he didn't make a backup, you can be sure that was intentional",11RhOzrpb9,-1
"They did everything they could to catch it. The fraud was anticipated at the beginning of Covid at the earliest. Not some Q shit like 5 years ago. Our “justice system” which I am shamefully a part of as an attorney, failed them at every turn as did every other system of government put in place to ensure free and fair elections. If nothing else, the obvious fraud and treasonous certification thereof showed us just how deep and complete the deep state is. Our government at ever level is corrupt and broken. Under the Dec. of Ind. The People have a Right and Duty to
Overthrow and dismantle such a broken government and install a new one. The cost is high but the reward/benefit is priceless. Although, a lot of things happening now seem to align with some big Q drops over the last several years. I’m not a Q guy, but I’ll cling to whatever hope I can right now. Idgaf what anyone thinks.",11RhOzrpb9,4
"Yes they did, there was a huge sting operation. They caught them all. Trump has said so several times.",11RhOzrpb9,0
"It's bigger than Trump at this point. He brought us to the 1 yard line, whether part of it or not. If we stay pissed off like we are today for 10 years, we will be okay. If we shrug and get complacent, it's over. But possibility that this was all a setup for Biden to come in and go after guns. Because ""violent right wing terrorism"".",11RhOzrpb9,0
This is the only reason I believe the emergency broadcast theory.,11RhOzrpb9,6
I disagree with you sir. He should have left it a long time ago like the mods were smart enough to do with this site. The audience would have followed,11RhOzrpb9,16
"He should have used a middle platform that sends the same information to multiple services. If the same information was sent to Twitter, Facebook, GAB, and perhaps a direct website then one or two platforms wouldn't have the power to censor.",11RhOzrpb9,1
"no fuck you! he was and is the show. he should've moved over, and bring in his 88M followers. get lost!",11RhOzrpb9,7
Don’t tell me to get lost you dumb bitch. You are probably one of the people on here giving up hope acting like it’s all over. Fuck everyone on this site that is giving up hope. You all might as well let China take you over now you fags,11RhOzrpb9,-3
"you're a fucking retard, and probably a Dementia Joe voter larping. fuck off you bird brain",11RhOzrpb9,2
Why are you on this site then if you have given up? Trying to bring people down? You are probably a communist,11RhOzrpb9,-1
"again, YOU'RE A CHYNA BIDEN voter. Admit it! prove where ""i have given up."" and i will hold Trump to task for not moving over to alt tech. his 88M followers would've gone to whatever platform, parler or gab, and he would've had his thoughts un censored. what fucking part of that don't you understand?",11RhOzrpb9,0
You sound dumb.,11RhOzrpb9,-1
Now He should move to Parler.,11RhOzrpb9,6
"I'm trying to get on Parler, it just keeps timing out.",11RhOzrpb9,3
Having the same problem.,11RhOzrpb9,3
Yeah I think Parler is overloaded since today’s purge,11RhOzrpb9,1
Google has removed parler from the play store and Apple says they'll follow,11RhOzrpb9,0
maybe DDos or AWs taking them down,11RhOzrpb9,0
Fuck any platform that asks for your phone number to sign up. Gab doesn't ask for it.,11RhOzrpb9,1
You don’t use a platform to only talk to your echo chamber. Why do you think they are echo chambers? Are you retarded? The reason why they are that way is because twitter ban those who have wrong think. Imagine unironically defending using Twitter when they are responsible for the echo chambers you complain about.,11RhOzrpb9,1
The only reason why I joined Twitter in the first place is because I could get info straight from Trump. I guess that’s over. Time to delete my account.,11RhOzrpb9,22
dont need an account to read tweets. only need an account to post your own comments,11RhOzrpb9,16
That's what pisses me off about parler. I don't want a social media account. I font want to give you my email address and phone number. I want to go to the people I want to read without another company selling my information to China.,11RhOzrpb9,11
i read parler without an account,11RhOzrpb9,2
you can read parler accounts without creating an account. just search for the account you want to read,11RhOzrpb9,1
I created one to add likes and retweets to Trump,11RhOzrpb9,1
I had just joined Parler and then discovered they had permanently banned DJT on Twitter. I immediately deactivated my Twitter account.,11RhOzrpb9,10
Me too. Literally the only reason. Gained some followers and shit on some liberals but it’s pointless without Trump,11RhOzrpb9,1
"THIS...all fucking day. The commies are losing their shit all over the place with Twitter, impeachment 12 days before the 20th. Maybe THEY don’t know where the fuck he is or what the fuck he’s doing. Declass...why else are they acting so desperate?",11RhOzrpb9,15
"Well, here's a theory-they fear what's coming?",11RhOzrpb9,2
Their reaction. It's strange. Maybe he's in Texas preparing the helicopters?,11RhOzrpb9,2
not with xiden in control they arent,11RhOzrpb9,3
xiden's not in control yet,11RhOzrpb9,3
xiden is the puppet. look at the puppet master,11RhOzrpb9,1
of what your stupidy! YOU IDIOTS FUCKED HIM,11RhOzrpb9,-5
"The censorship of the highest office is some absolute bullshit. But I'm not gonna lie, I'm kinda relieved to finally be able to kill my Twitter account and uninstall that bullshit. I only ever used it to keep up with GEOTUS and salt mine on his tweets.",11RhOzrpb9,6
That’s why I don’t understand all the talk about section 230. Fuck more regulation we should just build a better website with our rules and go there,11RhOzrpb9,4

"None of those Tweets violated any policy that should result in a ban. Something is going on, guys!",11RhOzrpb9,15
What's going on is they're trying to gaslight the court of public opinion to add momentum for impeachment.,11RhOzrpb9,9
"Something is going on. It's called a dictatorship being installed, and the remains of the Constitution null and void.",11RhOzrpb9,8

"I think you’re right about the exposure part, he woke enough people up and revealed the truth so hard that now he can hand us the reigns, there’s way too many of us to just hand wave away, the next populist candidate will be the REAL one, he just showed them how to win, and what the stakes were, just like he said he would.",11RhOzrpb9,2

Stop. Stop this. There’s no fucking plan. He is doing nothing. If there was a plan then something would’ve happened. As much as I hope he’s doing something I’m almost certain it’s over.,11RhOzrpb9,54
"Agreed. There's no ace up the sleeve, no mind boggling twist in the plot where the good guy comes back to win. This isn't Hollywood. The legal disputes will continue ignored by the media, any charges brought against Biden from the laptop will be swept under the rug or simply used to remove Biden and install Harris into the presidency. Even those processed will take months to carry out, not the 12 days we need. The only action left for Trump to take is declassification of the dirt. Then it's up to us to retake the country from the heathens who will kill us to prevent justice and liberty from living.",11RhOzrpb9,35
"Trump could fire every one of those suspected of being a rat tonight. Bring in Bannon, Lewindowski or other based head hunters and try to clean house. Then order full declassification of everything through them.",11RhOzrpb9,-4
I'm prrtty sure he has no power anymore. full betrayal.,11RhOzrpb9,9
"I've said this many times today and agree with what I saw on Infowars. He may have been confronted by Pence along with some traitorous cabinet members and some generals and told to sit back, be quiet, do what we tell you. Otherwise they will all go public from the House floor and declare him unfit for office and 25th Amendment him. He has no twitter account and would never be able to get his side out to the public. It may be why they have taken his twitter account down. So he has no way to reach the public.",11RhOzrpb9,4

I noticed that immediately. Horrific,11RhOzrpb9,16

And seemed like she was on the verge at times during.,11RhOzrpb9,13
She did look shaken up. Her hair wasn't fixed up and the press release was quickly rattled off and then she walked out. She was forced to put that out and she knew it was wrong.,11RhOzrpb9,2

Without an unprecedented paradigm shift where Mexican's begin voting Republican the state will flip blue when the current crop of kids turn 18 as they are already less than half white.",11RhOzrpb9,0

Absolutely. Scary to think how much damage a militia could do to our above ground electrical grid in a short amount of time relatively quick even without any kind of major explosives. Also the nation's fuel supply could be shut down fast also. Rail systems too. 2-300 men on a mission could bring this country to a screaming halt fast.

"They were just waiting for the right time. They smell blood in the water due to the election farce, and are now trying to cut him off at the knees. We all knew this was coming eventually. It's a coordinated effort on all liberal fronts. The only way they stop is if we fight back.",11RhOzrpb9,33
"Exactly, they feel so big, bad, and brave now! What are you doing",11RhOzrpb9,1
"Considering how coordinated the attack on Trump's Social Media was, I doubt Dorsey had any say. There is a Chinese polit commisar somewhere that calls the shots.",11RhOzrpb9,4

"They are delighted, they have an opportunity to do whatever they want, using the ""violent insurrection"" as an excuse. Someone posted this bit from the book ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"": On the day following the fire, February 28, he prevailed on President Hindenburg to sign a decree ""for the Protection of the People and the State"" suspending the seven sections of the constitution which guaranteed individual and civil liberties. Described as a ""defensive measure against Communist acts of violence endangering the state,"" the decree laid down that: Restrictions on personal liberty, on the right of free expression of opinion, including freedom of the press; on the rights of assembly and association; and violations of the privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications; and warrants for house searchers, orders for confiscations as well as restrictions on property, are also permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed. In addition, the decree authorized the Reich government to take over complete power in the federal states when necessary and imposed the death sentence for a number of crimes, including ""serious disturbances of the peace"" by armed persons.""",11RhOzrpb9,4
"In hindsight Trump never should have relied exclusively on them in the first place. A better option would be to comment on some platform he controls (whitehouse.gov or his own website), then mirror the comment across multiple social media platforms so one platform can't control his ability to interact with the public. What's done is done I guess. Time for him to move to Parler or create an account here.",11RhOzrpb9,35
"I don't know, it's a much bigger deal this way. What we want right now is for them to boil the frog too fast so that regular people cannot continue to ignore the destruction of their rights. They are doing a marvelous job. In the absence of a Trump victory, this is what we want.",11RhOzrpb9,10
"I want to believe that he has a reason for not doing what you suggested, because the alternative is that he's actually a shitty strategist. We've all seen this ban coming for months, so he surely had to have anticipated it.",11RhOzrpb9,4
"Twitter is easy to post to personally, making a post on a website and mirroring it isn't that streamlined/easy for someone who's 70 years old. He might be a genius but he's also not a computer wiz, and wouldn't want to trust any of his direct comms to others. (eg: everyone here trusted Pence while me and Lin were railing on him, what if he had given him access because he trusted him?)",11RhOzrpb9,1
"In hindsight, unless a fucking miracle happens over the next few days, Trump's biggest mistake was coloring inside the lines while the left doesn't care about the rules. The media and the left called him Hitler the entire time; might as well have taken it in stride and exercised some real power to fix things. Instead, he let himself get dicked around by Wray, Sessions, Mueller, Barr, etc, etc, etc. What the fuck was he waiting around on for FOUR years? I love GEOTUS and I'm reserving my real judgement until the 20th. But if it comes to pass that there really was no plan all along for something that to millions of us was CLEAR AS FUCKING DAY, it's time to take matters into our own hands and snag every local political office and grassroots this change. Bloody civil war is not an option because Xi spends 4 hours every day jerking off thinking about that happening.",11RhOzrpb9,2
This is correct. He should have developed his own platfirm or moved to parler while he was still in the early years of his term to drive traffic there and away from twitter,11RhOzrpb9,0
"We've had presidents a lot longer than Twitter has existed. When America was a real country, with a real nation, patriotism was basically universal and most anyone would be honored to carry the president's words. Now we live in Escape From New York world where no one really gives a shit. Social media accounts should be considered property. Banning should be impossible. The reform that Section 230 needs is separation of moderation and platform. ""Good faith"" is a vague term that Leftists love to abuse.",11RhOzrpb9,9

This. They've been waiting for the opportunity,11RhOzrpb9,40
"Nah, pair this with the panic in DC and it’s clear something is going on. If Trump was really conceding why would they be scrambling to silence and remove him before the “next administration” is inaugurated? Doesn’t add up. They don’t act this frantic usually. And if they were just showing force, then congress would look a lot more sanctimonious than they do right now.",11RhOzrpb9,12
enjoy your ban,11RhOzrpb9,1
Or they are fucking emboldened.,11RhOzrpb9,55
"No they are not. Stop with the bullshit. You don't piss off the people you are terrified of, you piss off the people you can crush. The MSM, and big tech didn't start this shit until they got more and more powerful. Initially, Trump could tweet anything and there no labels and no actions taken by Twitter and Facebook. Then they started to add warnings when they knew he couldn't touch them, then they started to delete posts and they finally suspended him as his presidency is almost over. This whole retarded talk of how they are absolutely terrified about to what is about to come (hint nothing favorable to us is coming) is pissing off to no end. If they are terrified, they would appeal to Trump's good graces, not ban him.",11RhOzrpb9,53
It's both actually. They are terrified what happens if he wins this battle.,11RhOzrpb9,6
"This battle is over. They are not terrified of Trump anymore. If they were, they would be playing nice and talking about unity and shit. They now have power, and they are using it to punish us.",11RhOzrpb9,12
no they would not be talking unity. they know trump would go scorched earth anyways. they are simply doubling down. again. like always. they havent learned. this is the final bluff call though. now trump will play his final cards.,11RhOzrpb9,-2
"Trump isn't playing any final cards. Twitter and Jack wouldn't get themselves in the middle of this shit if they thought they would be harmed in any way. They would have stayed neutral and let it all play out. They banned him because they are no longer afraid of him. If you are going to suggest some bullshit, at least have the decency to say what it is that you think is going to happen. This vague Q type shit about a plan, and it is coming, tick tock, etc. is pointless.",11RhOzrpb9,4
you can give up now. ill wait till the 20th. dont be a pussy.,11RhOzrpb9,-2

"Yeah I just saw right now. Well, it’s over. Not just for us, but for the rest of the world RIP.",11RhOzrpb9,0
You are delusional. Go and see what literally all the Democrats and Nancy have been saying today. You don't do that if you're confident. You don't ban Trump if you're confident and cocky. They know more than we do and they are shitting themselves.,11RhOzrpb9,-2
They're doing exactly what I would do if I was a piece of shit who hated America and thought that I could get away with it.,11RhOzrpb9,11
"It's narrative control to excuse their actions to their base. Their actions aren't those of people terrified of Trump, but of those who have, at last, succeeded in their objectives and are finally gutting and cleaning up what's left of their successful conquest. Their base is being pandered to, hyped up, and scared so that they fall in line and accept the actions being taken. They aren't scared at all.",11RhOzrpb9,8
"Yes, you do. If you have complete control, and you hate your enemies, you can crush them. This is what is happening now. It is time to wake up from your delusions about shoes that are dropping soon, military this, nuke that, or whatever flavor of conspiracy bullshit you subscribe to. We are being purged because the dems are now in complete control. Wake the fuck up.",11RhOzrpb9,5
Cut out a mans tongue and you don’t disprove him. You merely tell the world you fear what he has to say.,11RhOzrpb9,14

They made a mistake. Now they won't know his next move.,11RhOzrpb9,2

"what a funny motherfucker you are, you know damn well they would ban trump in the end",11RhOzrpb9,2
No kidding? Do you have a quick rundown on that?,11RhOzrpb9,1
Anything you could think of that would poke a stick into Trump will be done by the 20th.,11RhOzrpb9,1
"Not a complete ban. And q predicted this two or three years ago. Long before Alex Jones was deplatformed. A sitting president was just deplatformed. He has one of the biggest support bases on social media, and they censored him. Not just him, anything relating to him is getting whacked.",11RhOzrpb9,7
Yeah I'm sure you predicted this 4 years ago too,11RhOzrpb9,1
"I also predicted that I was going to take a shit sometime this week. Turns out I have prophetic powers as well. Q is crack for boomers and that's it. This isn't a movie where the good guy gets back up after being shot 20 times in the chest. I wonder how many people were parroting ""trust the plan"" as Stalin was sending them to Siberia?

This. I’m dooming because we’ve never won anything. Just Qtards saying “muh 4D chess” even though NOTHING has happened in our favor. I highly doubt it’ll start now.,11RhOzrpb9,8
I would see it as a good sign if Trump fired all of his senior staff this weekend. If he was in communication with Flynn and Bannon to come on board and help him lop of heads. This is something I've been wishing for 4 years but he keeps these people around. I think he's threatened with 25th Amendment BS if he considers doing it which is why they all need to go.,11RhOzrpb9,1

Just deleted my account. Fuck Twitter.,11RhOzrpb9,9
What in the fuck is happening,11RhOzrpb9,142
The communists are taking over.,11RhOzrpb9,46
It's habbening guys! KEK wills it!,11RhOzrpb9,2
The burner with the pot of water holding the frogs inside was just cranked. They may be overplaying their hand.,11RhOzrpb9,-1
The free market is working,11RhOzrpb9,-5
the only cuck here is you BELIEVE IN THIS MAN,11RhOzrpb9,17
Wait until a few more applications come in and they can cover your Saturday afternoon shift at Burger King.,11RhOzrpb9,1
"I think it's over to, but he in no way cucked. He stood by himself against the entire deep state for nearly five years. He gave up everything to do it. Everyone has their limit. hurr durr he didn't stand alone he had us Were you there in the white house with the snakes along side him? Or were you herejerking off like the rest of us. He didn't cuck.",11RhOzrpb9,6
if he truly had no allies at the government level... then how in the world did he win the first time? we learned that they have the balls to literally pause the count to invent fake ballots over the course of a week. we learned that they can literally just transfer votes with the machines connected to the internet. something different happened in 2016 to allow him to get in in the first place. what's the difference? the fake pandemic? surely that can't be it?,11RhOzrpb9,-4
They didn't expect him to win over beloved Hillary.,11RhOzrpb9,1
That's not the same thing as cucking. Do you people just throw that word around for anything you don't like these days?,11RhOzrpb9,1

10 days of darkness?,11RhOzrpb9,110
4 years of qtardedness,11RhOzrpb9,14
4 days of muh lin wood gonna save western civilization,11RhOzrpb9,10
"Stop with the Q bullshit already. Q is a larp, you fell for it, move on with your life.",11RhOzrpb9,11
Q was perfect to get tens of millions of people to sit back for 4 years and jerk off with cheeto-dust covered fingers instead of trying to affect real change. Probably a leftist psyop.,11RhOzrpb9,4
"Yep, and judging by the downvotes on my comment, the Qtards are still ~50% of the people here.",11RhOzrpb9,1
They can downvote all they want but it turns out that “patriots are in control” was bullshit. We don’t have the courts. We don’t have the media. We lack big tech. Universities. Congress. Courts. About to lose the presidency. Q Faqqots need to explain,11RhOzrpb9,0
"Add in the DOJ, FBI, and all of the other three letter agencies, the DOJ, and basically every bureaucrat as well. We have the support of roughly half the populace and that is it.",11RhOzrpb9,3
"Its a DoD/NSA seeder. Somewhat insidious, but not a larp.",11RhOzrpb9,-1
"It's a LARP. Either it was a psyop to subvert our movement that worked amazingly well on some people for absolutely no reason, or it is a LARP. I am going with LARP.",11RhOzrpb9,4
Sounds like you're the larper here.,11RhOzrpb9,-7
"Yeah, how dare I bring a dose of reality to the Qtards. Q is lie, time to get over it. It accomplished absolutely nothing and was wrong about 99.99999% of all his predictions.",11RhOzrpb9,3
NO MORE TV FOR YOU!,11RhOzrpb9,-4
"I don't have a tv, and I haven't watched any news coverage from the MSM since before election day. Q is still bullshit that you morons fell for. Take some time to think things through and detox from that toxic cult bullshit that surround Q.",11RhOzrpb9,0
He should already have one.,11RhOzrpb9,30
"He saved this site by not doing so. Any place he goes is a target. Look at Gab, Parler. Lets just pray he is okay and can see us .",11RhOzrpb9,31
If you think we're not a target I've got bad news for you.,11RhOzrpb9,16
Yep. This site will be nuked before the end of the month.,11RhOzrpb9,7
"This site will be banned within days if not hours. Their hosts have already threatened to drop them if the moderators don't clean things up, e.g. crack down on free speech. They create new rules and set impossible standards that only apply to Trump supporters so that they can pretend that they gave you a chance when in reality they've already committed to the ban.",11RhOzrpb9,3
He does. He's never come on. Just like how he'd grovel to the MSM but gave one whole interview to Breitbart after they helped him cross the line,11RhOzrpb9,-2
"Or go to Parler, they already reserved an account for him.",11RhOzrpb9,1
This place will be gone in days.,11RhOzrpb9,0
Lmao of course he did,11RhOzrpb9,79
maybe he already has?,11RhOzrpb9,3
"PARLER OR GAB! FUCK TWITTER Without Trump, Twitter will go the way of myspace. What are they so afraid of? Really? Something is going on...",11RhOzrpb9,70
"Dude stfu with this ""it will hurt Twitter"" bs. They are not a business. They are an arm of our corrupt ruling class.",11RhOzrpb9,71
"Awoman. No amount of boycotting will ever hurt big tech. Its a tool for controlling perception and speech absolutely. It is every tyrant's wet dream manifested into reality. It allows them to do more than Stalin could have ever imagine possible. These knee-jerk reactions are no different than saying you're going to primary a rino, next election",11RhOzrpb9,16
They are an arm of our corrupt ruling class slave masters known as the eight little dudes of the Federal Reserve. ftfy,11RhOzrpb9,1
Owned by the Saudis too,11RhOzrpb9,0
"Look, I think the president leaving Twitter will definitely put a cramp in Twitter. How much of Twitter is bots and people like us with multiple troll accounts?",11RhOzrpb9,0
The Democrats will just bail them out.,11RhOzrpb9,-1
"Twitter don't need conservatives to survive ,they are global with users from all over the world increasing day by day",11RhOzrpb9,14
You'd be surprised how many of those accounts are our troll accounts and bots! lol,11RhOzrpb9,-1
I can appreciate that. Solid reason,11RhOzrpb9,2
Minds has been pretty solid in my experience. And I'd rather not touch Gab.,11RhOzrpb9,2
What's wrong with Gab? Never heard of Minds. Rumors say Trump going to Parler,11RhOzrpb9,2
"For one I just don't generally like how the site works, really sloppy on mobile in my experience. Then there's the people who run it and how they act. I remember in 2019 they banned NSFW content across the entire site. Totally their choice and I don't particularly care if they do, but how they responded to the backlash was childish at best. Went on a several month war on Twitter with anyone criticizing that decision. It was really pathetic to watch, gave a terrible impression of them. Having them argue to what really counts as ""Free speech"" and what not.",11RhOzrpb9,2
God helps those that help themselves. If you are unwilling to stand up for yourself and do what is necessary God isn't going to do anything to help you because you are guilty of the sin of sloth.,11RhOzrpb9,8
Well said. We need to act NOW.,11RhOzrpb9,2
HOLY FUCK WE ARE OVER TARGET WTF IS HAPPENING,11RhOzrpb9,59
Getting shot down and blown up.,11RhOzrpb9,8
lol I'm dead,11RhOzrpb9,3
Bang Ding Ow,11RhOzrpb9,1
The Great Reset of 2021.,11RhOzrpb9,55
"People have been brainwashed into thinking Twitter, some dipshit website that sprang up 10 years ago, is now the sole means of communication in the world.",11RhOzrpb9,30
MSM already cuts away from Trump remarks and decide not to give him a platform. How else can he communicate? Twitter was at least a continuous stream of contact.,11RhOzrpb9,3
"With lockdowns in place and it being one of the only 3 major outlets for digital speech, in some ways it isn't far from that.",11RhOzrpb9,0
I think it’s called a coup.,11RhOzrpb9,12
lol no they're not. They know no one is going to stop them.,11RhOzrpb9,47
Not really. What do they have to fear after all this?,11RhOzrpb9,26
They literally just got away with stealing the election. No one can stop them now.,11RhOzrpb9,18
Nah....Jack & Co have never had anything to fear. Jack is BOSS,11RhOzrpb9,0

can't believe our patriots don't know the difference between coommunism and faccism. Bet they celebrate mlk as a hero,11RhOzrpb9,1
"Meh. Communism, Nazism, fascism, socialism: you're all tiny cocks, anyway.",11RhOzrpb9,0
Here we go,11RhOzrpb9,43
Q was actually wrong every day for 4 years,11RhOzrpb9,118
So I shouldn't expect anything from those 6 million secret sealed indictments Sessions and Mueller were supposed to deliver?,11RhOzrpb9,16
Are they for us?,11RhOzrpb9,6
You can expect a knock on your door.,11RhOzrpb9,3
It’s statistically impressive,11RhOzrpb9,1
Because it's a fucking larp. Breaks my heart to see that my side has people this gullible.,11RhOzrpb9,11
"I always wondered if it was an iarpa project. I knew it wasn't one person. The writing styles were varied, sometimes even within the same post. Much of the technical detail goes over my head, but I know a lot about psyops and can confirm that whoever the blue person is, he knows his shit.",11RhOzrpb9,2
good read thanks pede,11RhOzrpb9,1
"Yeah I've looked through this stuff, this is peak theoretical understanding 200iq shit.",11RhOzrpb9,1

Just see black images,11RhOzrpb9,2
Rudy said 10 days on the 6th. Back in April they were talking about 10 days of darkness involving communication and social media blackouts... I am no Q guy but just wanted to point it out.,11RhOzrpb9,39
Yeah Q was obviously wrong about some things (like William Barr) but he could be right about some things I guess.,11RhOzrpb9,4
"Yes, it takes some real geniuses with lots of insight to have predicted that twitter would ban Trump.",11RhOzrpb9,9

Holy fucking shit.,11RhOzrpb9,39
They are literally purging all of us they will come for this website eventually once they work their way down from the top,11RhOzrpb9,38
"It's strange to me. What do they think it will achieve? People aren't going to stop believing in their ideals just because their figureheads are banned, if anything it just inflames them and strengthens their resolve.",11RhOzrpb9,9
"Yes and no. The only way that it works is if they keep it going for a generation. If a generation passes under Communism, it's really hard to pull back out of it.",11RhOzrpb9,1
"They'll let the plebians believe what they want ... in private. If you speak out about it, though, the NKVD will black bag you and you'll never be heard from again. It doesn't matter what the people believe. It matters what they're willing to say and do about it. Everyone on this board is probably on a shortlist for people to be ""taken care of"" at some point.",11RhOzrpb9,1
"I think the main thing that has pushed me further to the right over the past 4 years is the behaviour of the left. The constant bannings, the pointless women's march, the hysterics over Kavanaugh, the college campus protests and deplatforming, the bizarre reaction to ""It's okay to be White"", and of course the year long BLM/antifa rioting and murder spree over a drug-addled loser. It's the hypocrisy of the treatment of left vs right that makes me think it's all just powerful propaganda. Objectively the right have been relatively peaceful these past few years, Trump's presidency was a 4 year respite from decades of war, yet the left have been convinced he's the devil incarnate.",11RhOzrpb9,1
"What do they think it will achieve? It will prevent 2016 happening again. They fucked up and lost control of the narrative that cycle, they will not be allowing that to happen again.",11RhOzrpb9,0
I guess calling for peace violates Twitter's TOS. Fine. They won't get peace.,11RhOzrpb9,37
We all knew this was coming. It should not be a surprise to anybody.,11RhOzrpb9,37
It’s still very unsettling,11RhOzrpb9,11
Just remember that it wasn't that long ago that twitter didn't exist and we communicated just fine.,11RhOzrpb9,6
"That is correct. But that is like a Native American saying that it wasn’t long ago they didn’t have horses or guns, and they fought just fine",11RhOzrpb9,1
That wasn't Trump.,11RhOzrpb9,0
You going to shoot the data center's x foot concrete wall now? Lol,11RhOzrpb9,1

"I thought He said he was going to Parler earlier . Twitter was such a liberal shithole.
Good Riddance.",11RhOzrpb9,29
And apple has already come out saying they’re going to ban Parler,11RhOzrpb9,15
On apple App Store I don’t have any apps so Ban Away,11RhOzrpb9,8
"Apple can’t ban a website, they can ban an app. Use it in the browser on your phone or PC",11RhOzrpb9,4
"Yea sorry I wasn’t clear, but still.",11RhOzrpb9,1
"is your user same on instagram??
edit: he deleted his account LOL. Instagrammer with 300k followers",11RhOzrpb9,1
It’s not like you can’t just use a web browser,11RhOzrpb9,2
Maybe this is the reason for the 24 hr Parler ultimatum from Apple,11RhOzrpb9,1
They are so scared of the truth....,11RhOzrpb9,25

that’s why ^,11RhOzrpb9,1
And they just signed their death wish. And not just the business side of things either.,11RhOzrpb9,19
Holy shit. Pray.,11RhOzrpb9,17
Did anyone not see this coming?,11RhOzrpb9,8
That's what I'm saying. The writing has been on the wall for that ever since the SCOTUS case preventing him from blocking. The muted tweets since Nov 3 were the next sign.,11RhOzrpb9,2
What's the video?,11RhOzrpb9,4
"And from same drop (June 4th), ""RED2: Central communications blackout [continental US]"" Not saying it's real, but a blackout wouldn't surprise me at this point. Not at all.",11RhOzrpb9,2
Thanks for the context. I'll be watching but I'm dooming hard. God bless and stay safe.,11RhOzrpb9,1
Um wasn't that a birthday party and he was holding a big card?,11RhOzrpb9,1
"It's prior to his speech on Wednesday, and it's a red folder.",11RhOzrpb9,2
"Holy shit, and look at the manner he was standing, and then picking up the folder, almost like.. ""ohhh lookey here, whats this"" as someone who just happens to be recording",11RhOzrpb9,3
There has been talk of Trump being banned on twitter for literally years. Anyone can come up with a list starting with something obvious and make the rest of the list look like prophecy. It's bullshit.,11RhOzrpb9,2
Here we go...,11RhOzrpb9,15
